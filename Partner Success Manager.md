<p><strong>Partner Success Manager</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: US, Remote</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an empathetic, curious and experienced professional to join our Customer Success Organization to help retain and grow Snyk’s strategic partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will work alongside our Partner Alliances team and peers within our Global Customer Services org to ensure the holistic success of Snyk’s strategic partnerships. You will bring strong relationship-building experience, product knowledge, project management, organizational and problem-solving skills, as well as a high degree of empathy to maintain a best-in-class partner and customer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will maintain a deep understanding of our Partners’ businesses and be an internal champion of the features/functionality most critical to their specific business needs. You'll be expected to meet and exceed the goal for net retention (both retention and expansion) -- which is driven through consistent communication and collaboration with our Partner Alliance team&nbsp; and by demonstrating the value the products and services provide to their business via quarterly reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the role will sit on the Customer Success Team in order to maintain familiarity with best practices and processes to continue to ensure the success of our joint customers, this is a truly cross-functional position. You will work closely with Product, Professional Services, Customer Support and other teams to close the feedback loop on customer and market needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Enterprise CSM, you’ll spend your time:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building and fostering trusted relationships with leaders from our customers’ engineering and security organizations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work with your Partner account teams to plan and execute customized onboarding programs helping partners achieve their security program goals through the use of Snyk’s suite of products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocating for and representing the voice of the Partner internally and mobilizing internal and external resources to remove barriers to adoption</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing and facilitating business review meetings, training sessions, product feedback/roadmap reviews, and other strategic customer interactions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be a key member of the team managing the partnership life cycle which includes initial launch and technical integrations or enablement, maintaining a healthy steady state, quarterly goals assessment, product roadmaps and executive alignment, and renewal of the partnership.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work cross-functionally with Partnerships, Product, Engineering, Support, Marketing and other teams to resolve partner business issues and work towards their stated goals</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should apply if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bachelor’s degree, MBA or equivalent experience strongly preferred</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have 5+ years of progressive experience in a customer-facing professional role</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can demonstrate working knowledge of Developer or Application Security tools (e.g. GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, VScode)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proven ability to develop working relationships at all levels of management, both inside your company and within your customer accounts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience with project management, account portfolio planning and prioritization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are an effective and influential communicator with a range of personas (from end user to C-level executive); you can facilitate challenging discussions and are adept at handling objections</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrive in a collaborative, fast-paced environment and as a part of a results oriented team</span></li>
</ul>
