<p><strong>Software Engineering, Platform Group</strong></p>
<p><strong>UK, Israel and Switzerland.</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>We have offices in London, Tel Aviv and Zurich if you prefer not to work remotely.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a number of smart, caring and proactive senior software engineers to join our core product teams to help our enterprise customers adopt open source and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams in the Platform Group aim to build a scalable, extensible platform that is used by both our Snyk product offering teams and our Enterprise customers to solve complex challenges, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onboarding large developer teams onto our multi-tenant SaaS offering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing and reporting on all the data generated within the enterprise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying policies that ease security compliance as an integral part of the software development lifecycle process</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the teams will extend our ability to onboard customers 100x times larger than we have now; redesign and replatform our reporting offering from the ground up and build a flexible and extensible role-based authorization system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Snyk, you’ll use your knowledge and passion as a developer, along with your problem solving skills to help us develop software that, in turn, helps others to develop software that is and remains secure.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning everything from the commercial success to operational insight of specific features in our product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaging in problem analysis and collaborating with product to create plans that continue to delight our current users and win new ones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executing on those plans by coding across the full stack</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace, in two-week sprints&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promoting technical excellence across the team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentoring and coaching other engineers in the team &amp; group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking part in our on-call rotation to maintain and support our production service (for a week every ~10 weeks)</span></li>
