<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event Marketing Manager</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you absolutely love, and miss, events? Have you found a way to get the most of their temporary/new virtual reality? Are you equally passionate about the creative, analytical, and business relationships that make events successful? Are you hoping for a big career breakthrough in a company that is growing fiercely while also allowing you to focus on your own professional growth?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk we are looking for a driven and energetic event marketer to drive, develop and manage our growing calendar of global third party conferences in order to increase Snyk’s brand awareness, foster lead engagements, and create new sales opportunities. You’ll work closely across the marketing, DevRel, sales, and business development teams to help to identify the best tradeshows and conferences for Snyk around the world; manage the pre, during and post event planning; rethink how to make both virtual and in person events compelling; and report out regularly on business results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Getting creative. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will craft strategic event experiences that differentiate Snyk and ensure direct buyer connections, that are aligned to an overall marketing campaign strategy and in collaboration with our campaign marketers.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Planning, budgeting, measuring, and ROIing.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’ll be in control of each campaign’s plans, budgeting, goal setting for both lead and pipeline generation, and tracking towards the goals.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Scaling Snyk-hosted events. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering closely with the Event Marketing Director, you’ll execute against many components of SnykCon and other Snyk-hosted events.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideating. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strive to be the best marketing team the tech space has seen. We would like your help in ideating (and then executing) new, other activities we should bring into the fold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>

<p><strong style="font-size: 14px;">About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also raised an additional $200 Million, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-200m-to-modernize-security-industry/" target="_blank">announced on September 9, 2020</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">secure.</span></p>
