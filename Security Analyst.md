<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a curious, analytical and detail-oriented Security Analyst to join our team and help us uncover unknown vulnerabilities that exist in open source.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, much of any project's code relies on open source packages. These are out there in the world, visible for anyone, and within that code there are vulnerabilities. As part of our security team, you'll join us on our mission to continually improve our ability to find these open source vulnerabilities in a programmatic way.</span></p>
<p><strong>You'll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">triaging and analysing potential vulnerabilities discovered within open-source dependencies</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">further researching known vulnerabilities to determine characteristics such as severity and exploitability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using research to verify or disqualify potential vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">training machine learning models to find where vulnerabilities are mostly likely to lie, using a combination of our unique database of verified known vulns; information about how the open source community operates; and the static code itself</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing and testing theories and hypotheses around new areas that Snyk tackles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop our product to further achieve our mission</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll join our interdisciplinary security team, alongside fully dedicated engineers focussed on building tools that make your work more effective and have lots of opportunities to learn and grow. This role is particularly well-suited to help you develop a deep understanding of how code works, and over time you'll have the opportunity to work with just about every programming language.</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you have worked with researchers before, ideally in the security space or have conducted security research yourself</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you're comfortable working with large datasets (we use BigQuery; ideally you'll have used one of BigQuery, elasticsearch, kibana, hadoop etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you love to automate your work, through writing your own scripts (we use Python and JavaScript)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you have previous experience working with open source codebases</span></li>
</ul>
