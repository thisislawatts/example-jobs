<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to build security into development - the only way security can scale. To get such dev adoption, we built a dev tooling company, not a cyber company. We’re looking to delight and engage developers as we help them secure what they build. This approach spans the entire company, from product to commercial to community - which is where you come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DevRel content team plays a strategic role in Snyk. First, it aims to mobilize the developer and security communities to embrace a new way of building software, integrating continuous security into the development to ensure fast, secure software delivery.. Secondly, it is responsible for much of the growth of Snyk’s free user base, accelerating Snyk’s business success along with advancing the practices of cloud native software development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an experienced and passionate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technical writer to help the Marketing and DevRel teams drive awareness and adoption of DevSecOps practices and Snyk’s products. You will play an important role in our emerging content engine, creating unique and compelling stories via blog posts, Q&amp;As, videos, web copy, and more. The goal of the content will be to educate, empower, and encourage developers to understand the DevSecOps approach; guidance on how to build secure code; and motivate developers and DevOps teams to own application security across the cloud-native stack</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).

By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also raised an additional $150 Million, </span><a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-open-source-security-platform-snyk-raises-70m-1001300189"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span></a><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nnounced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/">January 21st, 2020</a>, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure</span></p>
