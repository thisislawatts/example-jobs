<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you absolutely love, and miss, events? Have you found a way to get the most of their temporary/new virtual reality? Are you equally passionate about the creative, analytical, and business relationships that make events successful? Are you hoping for a big career breakthrough in a company that is growing fiercely while also allowing you to focus on your own professional growth?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk we are looking for a driven and energetic event marketer to own, develop and manage our growing calendar of event programs to increase Snyk’s brand awareness, active lead engagements, and new sales opportunities. You’ll work closely across the marketing, DevRel, sales, and business development teams to identify the best events for Snyk; manage the pre, during and post event planning; rethink how to make both virtual and in person events compelling; and report out regularly on business results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Driving sales success.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’ll be the internal face of our events - working closely with our sales team to ensure we focus in the right regions and that programs are delivering the right leads and pipeline opportunities.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Managing a multitude of events.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Plan, organize, promote, coordinate and manage follow up to events ranging from hosted or sponsored executive roundtables to industry trade shows.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Execute event experiences</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> end-to-end with an "on-time, on-strategy, on-budget" mentality and a hands-on approach. You’ll deploy 360 degree digital and social tactics to drive buyer engagement before, during, and after the event.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Getting creative. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will craft event experiences that differentiate Snyk and ensure direct buyer connections, that are aligned to an overall marketing campaign strategy and in collaboration with our campaign marketers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aligning with ABM: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closely align with extended ABM teams to ensure outbound tactics are integrated with events as part of broader campaigns.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Manage&nbsp; vendor relationships.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You will partner with external agencies and vendors on existing engagements and new opportunities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Planning, budgeting, measuring, and ROIing.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’ll be in control of each campaign’s plans, budgeting, goal setting for both lead and pipeline generation, and tracking towards the goals.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideating. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strive to be the best marketing team the tech space has seen. We would like your help in ideating (and then executing) new, other activities we should bring into the fold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
