<p>We're looking for an experienced technical analyst with a proactive approach to problem-solving to join our Customer Support team, helping us to provide prompt and delightful technical support to the developers who use Snyk.</p>
<p><strong>Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.</strong>The use of open source is booming, but<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/">&nbsp;security is a key concern</a>. Our product enables developers and enterprise security to find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies, without slowing down development. Snyk integrates seamlessly into developer workflows so that security becomes business as usual.</p>
<p>Over 300,000 developers depend on Snyk to keep their software secure. We have many large organizations already on board and we are growing rapidly.</p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p>As a Technical Support Engineer on our Customer Support team, you’ll be the first line of defense against technical support issues that arrive via email and chat.&nbsp; The ideal candidate must be a self-motivated, strong team player with a proven track record of success in technical support.&nbsp; You will work with the Tier 2 team and our talented core engineering team to help solve Snyk’s customer issues. You will be working directly with active and prospective Snyk customers every day.</p>
<h3><strong>You'll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Understanding, reproducing and resolving complicated technical issues that our customers have raised.</li>
<li>Diving into our codebase, primarily written with <strong>NodeJS/Typescript</strong>, to figure out where the issue lies, and what a good solution might look like.</li>
<li>Providing expert communication, ensuring that every user knows exactly when they’ll hear back from us and providing regular updates while solving their problem.</li>
<li>Listening to our users’ needs, listening for recurring requests, and representing their voice in daily meetings with the Tier 2 and engineering teams.</li>
<li>Contributing to building up a best-in-class technical support function, including writing customer documentation and FAQs, building dashboards, or designing integrations between tools.</li>
<li>Over time, we’d love for you to have ambitions to develop your career as a developer or as a technical expert within Snyk!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>You love helping people and care deeply about providing an excellent customer experience</li>
<li>You take a logical approach to solving problems and prioritization.</li>
<li>You are a clear communicator, both verbally and in writing, and you enjoy explaining things to others.</li>
<li>You’re interested in security and you believe in our mission.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>More about Snyk</strong></h2>
<p>We mostly work in JavaScript, both front-end and back-end, and our architecture follows the microservices pattern. We are very happy to help you learn if you don’t have previous experience with these – we believe curiosity, communication, and the ability to learn are most important.</p>
<p>We work in geographically distributed teams and have offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston, Ottawa, Singapore and Australia. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around at least twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</p>

<p>We value diversity at Snyk, and would particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role but are not totally sure whether you’re the right person, please apply anyway!</p>
