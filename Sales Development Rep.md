<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an enterprising, ambitious Sales Development Representative to join our team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source software is booming: technology is integral to almost every facet of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t security experts</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a developer tooling company with deep security expertise: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of our fast-growing sales team, you’ll have great insight into how the full sales-cycle works, exposure to high profile customers, a strong technical grounding in our product, and lots of mentorship and training.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account mapping and researching potential accounts that fit our Ideal Customer Profile</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sourcing qualified contacts using our persona guidelines</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage tools to prioritise account out-reach</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrol accounts/contacts in customised sequences</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set meetings and generate pipeline for sales team </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about learning and development, and will support you as you grow. You’ll have opportunities to learn from experienced account execs, including participating in initial demonstrations, and gaining a deep understanding of how multiple selling motions work in a  high-growth technology company focussed on security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For high-achieving SDRs, we’ll support you as your progress into a high-commission account executive role.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are ambitious, organised and energetic</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You build strong, meaningful relationships and take pride in being a great communicator</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re driven: you strive to exceed your goals, and love the challenge of working in a fast-paced environment</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are collaborative and want to work in a diverse, high-performing team</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are resilient and continually working to be better</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re open, honest and love to learn</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re excited about technology and security, and you want to join a high-growth startup</span></li>
</ul>
