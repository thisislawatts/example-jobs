<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an experienced and empathetic architect - or engineer interested in moving into an architect role to join our Developer Workflows Group.&nbsp; The group creates tools that power a developerâ€™s everyday interaction with Snykâ€™s disruptive developer-first security platform, and is critical to their experience with Snyk. We focus on providing frictionless integrations that allow developers to consume security insights and remediate issues within their workflows. We focus on user behaviour and business metrics that are critical to the companyâ€™s success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Workflows team at Snyk is a very collaborative and welcoming group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remit of the group is broad, so we are looking to add a second architect to support a sub-group around integrations (such as CICD, repositories and build tools) and IDEs, while another group supports our source control management tools. You will have the opportunity to support the teams and staff within the group to help identify what integrations we should build for our customers; to build them in consistent and where possible reusable ways, all whilst ensuring any tool is idiomatic for each integration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an architect who is an engineer that has a longer time horizon with great communication and collaboration to work with teams, partners and customers. You would look for opportunities to drive consistency across the teams within the group, be a liaison into cross-org programs of work, ensuring that the teams every day decisions are aligned with the longer term goals and vision for the company and itsâ€™ products.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Workflows Group was established in 2021, bringing together teams solving inter-related challenges and this is an opportunity to help shape its direction. You will collaborate with the teams to create a vision to work towards, support our business development opportunities, research what tools we should be investing in for the future and seek opportunities to create better than the sum of its parts patterns and practices. You might contribute to proof of concept work, pair with engineers on new architectural concepts, or join in to support shipping a release. You will work with the Engineering Managers and Engineering Director to create, plan and deliver against a technical vision and plan, and liaise with other groups where there may be impact on the teams you support to ensure alignment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting to the UK based Director of Engineering, you will partner with the Engineering Managers, Engineers, Product Managers, and Architects within the group. You will also collaborate with Architects within the wider Developer Journeys Division and across the R&amp;D organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of the team live in either Israel or the UK, with some remote workers around Europe. We are an agile team, striving to find a balance between speed and quality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You care not only about building software right, but building the right thing. Ensuring we are building products that solve problems customers have, in ways they love, that work for the business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are you?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a versatile, experienced software engineer with an interest in architecture, or an architect with a strong engineering background.
