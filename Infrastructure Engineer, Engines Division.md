<p>We’re looking for an experienced infrastructure engineer to help scale Snyk’s component identification engine. You will work closely with a warm and caring team. Together you’ll use your creativity to create new exciting tooling that helps developers find and fix vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>You have relevant industry experience in automation and infrastructure to help deliver beautiful, reliable and fast service at scale. Teams at Snyk have a strong devops culture: the people who build the software, run the software. You will be learning and growing both your own skills and the skills of your team.</p>
<p>Within Snyk, all teams run their own infrastructure. While we are currently running parts of our software stack on a highly optimised self-maintained cloud based setup, we expect you to be comfortable in designing, implementing and maintaining services that run either in a fully managed environment (i.e. Kubernetes) or that needs its end-to-end optimised stack. In the former case, the focus will be on your skills relating to software development which is why we are looking for candidates strong in both software development and infrastructure.</p>
<p>We care deeply about the warm, inclusive working environment we've fostered, where we can benefit from the different perspectives within our team. We are collaborative, curious, and respectful - it’s important to us that everyone feels comfortable contributing their ideas and views.</p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the reliability of our platform and product via open source observability tools such as Grafana and Prometheus.</li>
<li>Implementing Infrastructure-as-code in order to support multiple cloud providers and deployment options.</li>
<li>Participating in an on-call rotation with the development team.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Along with the rest of the team create and optimize both the systems that run our back office service like CI/CD, and the frontend services offered to our customers. This includes automated build and deployment, secrets management, system observability, monitoring, log aggregation, scaling, and more.</li>
<li>Are or want to become comfortable crossing the border between development and infrastructure operations from one day to the next.</li>
<li>Helping the team create the needed tools and infrastructure to maintain scalability and reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have experience provisioning and running cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Have experience with infrastructure as code</li>
<li>Are familiar with a base service such as (Open)LDAP, DNS (bind) and OpenVPN in a Linux context</li>
<li>Enjoy working as part of a team and teaching others</li>
<li>Are fluent in English</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Manage infrastructure on AWS cloud or Linux servers.</li>
<li>Deploy and manage infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible.</li>
<li>Are passionate about all things security in an infrastructure context.</li>
<li>Have a familiarity with containerization, and have used Kubernetes and Podman.</li>
<li>Like to automate things as much as possible.</li>
<li>Have some programming experience.</li>
<li>Are curious and love to explore new domains, technologies, and approaches.</li>
</ul>
