<p class="p1"><strong>We’re looking for a driven Enterprise Renewals Rep to collaborate closely with both our Core Sales &amp; Customer Success Team, identifying opportunities in our existing client base by maintaining lasting relationships leading to retention of our customer logos.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The use of open source software is growing rapidly: technology is a core part of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/%23risk-and-impact"><span class="s1"> <em>aren’t security experts</em></span></a>. But our team is.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re a developer tooling company with deep security knowledge: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</p>
<p class="p2">We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Your role</strong></p>
<p class="p1">As an Enterprise Renewals Rep for Snyk, you’ll work closely with our Customer Success &amp; Core Sales teams to retain our customer’s footprint and identify opportunities to grow the Snyk product portfolio and usage within our install base. Our current customer base ranges from SMB companies with high velocity growth all the way up to strategic large enterprises like Google, Netflix and Salesforce.</p>
<p class="p1">We want you to contribute to the iterative style of our customer’s post sales journey all the way through to their subscription renewal. We encourage you to share ideas of how we can develop our internal tooling and processes to allow you to work most efficiently.</p>
<p class="p2">We’re a collaborative team from a variety of backgrounds, made up of sales executives and technical sales engineers. We spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team. This role reports to the Manager of Enterprise Renewals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4">Prioritizing and balancing the completion of renewals that are closest to their subscription expiration with those that are further out and require more strategic product roadmap education</li>
<li class="li4">Building strong relationships with our existing client base soon after they ink the deal (giving extra attention to those clients who haven’t heard from us in a while or have had to delay their product onboarding)</li>
<li class="li4">Mapping out how these organisations deliver AppSec: identifying how the different departments and teams interact, the internal processes required for getting things completed, and understanding how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within other areas of the business.</li>
<li class="li4">Becoming an expert at identifying and communicating the customer’s sentiment throughout all cycles of the customer’s post-sales journey</li>
<li class="li4">Participating in customer QBRs and collaborating on the creation of the materials presented</li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s2">Coordinating </span><span class="s3">across several multi-functional stakeholders such as Customer Success, Sales, Sales Engineering, Channel Partners, Legal, Product, and the deal desk to ensure maximum revenue is achieved when creating renewal proposals<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><strong>You should join us if:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s4">You have experience managing 50+ accounts, </span><span class="s3">negotiating $100k+ deals, as well familiarity with channel partners (resellers), all while navigating internal stakeholder requirements</span></li>
<li class="li4">You understand the software development lifecycle or application security space and can articulate how these two areas benefit organizations into creating a more secure development process<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s4">You feel comfortable </span><span class="s3">engaging in consultative discovery conversations to uncover account expansion opportunities, solidify current product investments, and negotiate multi-year subscription opportunities</span></li>
<li class="li4">You have a track record of maintaining consistent cadence with accounts in varying North American time zones<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="li4">You understand people and buying habits: what makes them tick, what their attitude is toward us, what they most likely need from us in order to buy</li>
<li class="li4">You’re organised, rigorous, and love to improve processes</li>
<li class="li4">You are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a startup that is well on its way to success</li>
<li class="li2">You’re self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced, collaborative teams</li>
</ul>
