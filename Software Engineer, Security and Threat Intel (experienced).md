<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a talented, thoughtful software developer to join our security team to work on our ML-enhanced vulnerability pipeline and management tools so that we can surface, verify, and</span><a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publish vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security team works to develop novel, effective methods to sift through likely vulnerabilities in open source which haven’t yet been discovered, verified, or disclosed. Through pulling them into our data pipeline, the team makes it as simple as possible for our security analysts and researchers to focus on validating them and adding them to our database.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Snyk, you’ll help us expand the reach of our vulnerability pipeline, and contribute to the building of our critical infrastructure that supports our analyst team to verify and publish all the vulnerabilities you find.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing algorithms into our data-intensive pipeline system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">modelling the data in our database and displaying it in our management system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engineering systems to scale (this is an ongoing effort, as the scale is constantly increasing)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enhancing systems to help our analyst team work more efficiently</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating and improving tooling to enable our security analysis and research work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working collaboratively with analysts to tackle issues with vulnerabilities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have proficient experience coding in Python</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience of JavaScript/TypeScript</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have recreated large scraping frameworks from design to implementation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience building infrastructure for large scale databases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about iterative improvement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">think really understanding a task is 80% of the success of a project</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appreciate being part of a diverse team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate proactively and speak English to a good standard</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We'd especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">really enjoy solving problems, and love learning new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are interested in security or open source software, and you believe in our mission</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but</span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q 2020 alone, Snyk had already over 600,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $200 million,</span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-200m-to-modernize-security-industry/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced Sep, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2021 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
