<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is a remote-friendly workforce, with over 10% of the company working fully remote and over 80% working hybrid, splitting time between home and one of our offices in Boston, London, Ottawa, Tel Aviv, or Zurich, or co-working locations in New York, Denver, or Singapore (and the list keeps growing). We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
