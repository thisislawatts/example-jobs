<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a commercially minded, energetic, financial athlete to join our finance team as the FP&amp;A manager. The individual will be responsible for leading day to day budget to actual reporting, financial forecasting, headcount tracking, and data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FP&amp;A team ensures Snyk stays on track to achieve its financial goals, supporting executive decision making along the way with timely, consistent, and accurate reporting. The team collaborates directly with department heads to help them better understand their cost structures and drive returns on investments. This year the team developed the annual operating plan, reported on the budget on a monthly cadence, and led a re-forecasting process at the conclusion of each quarter. On a weekly basis the team closely reported on Snyk’s headcount across multiple dimensions and analyzed cash balances, annual recurring revenue, churn, and retention metrics. On an ad hoc basis the team enthusiastically participated in numerous analyses for important partnership and M&amp;A activities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to lead a forecasting process and develop sophisticated financial models. You know how to work with financial forecasting tools such as NetSuite and/or Vena. You’ll use that knowledge to foster a collaborative budgeting environment across departments. Here at Snyk, you’ll bring a data driven approach to all conversations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing financial models and projections to support our company operating plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading monthly, quarterly and annual forecasting cycles across Snyk’s departments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serving as a trusted business partner and advisor to department heads, helping them to better understand their businesses and their performance to plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supporting the roll out of a brand new financial reporting system and promote opportunities for automation using IT solutions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating in Actuals Reporting &amp; Reconciliations, partnering with accounting to close the books and provide detailed business driver variances to Finance Business Partners.&nbsp;</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining a core set of SaaS metrics to gauge the company’s productivity and efficiency</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensuring on-time and accurate delivery of management reporting required for decision making</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we have teams across multiple offices, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripe, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity, and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
