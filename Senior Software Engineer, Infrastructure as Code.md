</ul>
<h2>You may be fit for this role if you</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a strong technical background, including 4+ years of professional experience building web services &amp; applications.</li>
<li>Strong oral and written communication skills and the ability to talk about potentially complex technical concepts in ways that make it easy for others to understand.</li>
<li>Have a people orientated, team-first mindset and are invested in building a high performing team as much as a successful product.</li>
<li>Have a high standards and opinions on topics such as code quality, testing and continuous delivery and enjoy working with others to raise the bar.</li>
<li>Enjoy working on early stage products; talking with customers to identify, prioritise and solve problems iteratively and build something that they really love.</li>
<li>Are comfortable working in a cross-functional team, working across the stack to deliver new features from ideation to production.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We value building a team with a diverse set of backgrounds and experience. This list is not an exhaustive list of skills we're looking for, nor should you feel like you need to meet all of them to apply.</em></p>
