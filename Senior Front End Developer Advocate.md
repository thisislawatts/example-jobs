<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a passionate, hands-on developer advocate to join our Developer Relations team to educate, empower and enable developers in application security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Relations team collaborates closely with developers to raise awareness of the importance of security in the application lifecycle, educating them through content, engineering, presentations, videos etc. about application security and pragmatic best practices they can use.</span></p>
<h2><strong>As a Developer Advocate at Snyk:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to apply good security practices in a software development lifecycle. You’ll use that knowledge to help developers in the community learn more about the role security plays in their applications and level up their security practices.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing awareness of the Snyk container platform</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educating open-source users and communities about the importance of DevSecOps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">producing great multimedia security content in a variety of different media : blog posts, videos, podcasts, cheat-sheets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing integrations and plugins to help users interact with Snyk in different environments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working closely together with our partners, customers, the development, product and marketing teams, and of course the broader developer communities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split evenly between London and Tel Aviv. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>have developed applications, integrations, plugins for front end applications, preferably in JavaScript.</li>
<li>have 3-5 years experience in a developer relations role</li>
<li>have shown and measured you can create impact in an ecosystem through your actions and deliverables</li>
<li>pride yourself on the quality and accessibility of your writing and teaching.</li>
<li>are at your best when immersed around developers and their communities.</li>
<li>care about both security and open source software, and are excited about learning how to live-hack demo repos!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>have strong experience in container platforms or open source projects</li>
<li>are comfortable preparing and presenting technical sessions and keynotes</li>
<li>have had previous, formal experience in developer advocacy leadership</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>About Snyk</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's an exciting time to join as we have carried the momentum we built in 2019 into the new year! Our January 2020 Series C funding round of $150M has tipped us over a $1Billion company valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
