<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a passionate, hands-on application security expert to join our Developer Relations team to educate, empower and enable developers in application security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Relations team collaborates closely with developers to raise awareness around the importance of security in the application lifecycle, educating them through content, engineering, presentations, videos, etc. about application security and pragmatic best practices they can use.</span></p>
<h2><strong>As a Security Advocate at Snyk:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to apply good security practices throughout the software development lifecycle. You’ll use that knowledge to help developers in the community learn more about application security and level up their application security practices.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing awareness around the Snyk platform</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educating open-source users and communities about the importance of DevSecOps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">producing great multimedia security content: blog posts, videos, podcasts, cheatsheets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing and nurturing our security community of developers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with our partners on co-marketing activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being the public face of Snyk at conferences, community meetups and customer events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working closely together with our partners, customers, the development, product and marketing teams, and of course the broader developer communities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split evenly between London, Boston, and Tel Aviv. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have previous application security experience: you’ve worked on a couple of different security teams and have experienced the best practices of building security into application pipelines</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pride yourself on the quality and accessibility of your writing and teaching</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are comfortable preparing and presenting technical talks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are at your best when immersed around developers and their communities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about both security and open source software, and are excited about learning how to live-hack demo repos!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hands-on, curious and love to learn as well as educate</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have strong experience in container platforms (especially Docker)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have prior development experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience working with security engineers, including security leads or CISOs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will spend around a quarter of your time travelling, so you will need to hold a valid passport at all times.</span></p>
