<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is actively working to identify a data-driven Event Marketing Manager to collaborate with our existing team and help us drive our business forward through world-class events and experiences for both prospects and customers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our mission is to help organisations use open source software and stay secure.</strong> Well over 450,000 developers have adopted Snyk as part of their workflow, we have over 400,000 projects, and over 1m patches, with a series of top brand customers on board (including Google, Skyscanner and Asos), and a large and ever-growing stream of incoming requests to buy Snyk Enterprise. We also recently raised a new funding round of $70 Million! </p>
<p>We’re focused on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities as they develop, and to help security and governance teams understand their status and drive improvement. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</p>
