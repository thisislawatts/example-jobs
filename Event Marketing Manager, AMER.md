<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event Marketing Manager</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you absolutely love, and miss, events? Have you found a way to get the most of their temporary/new virtual reality? Are you equally passionate about the creative, analytical, and business relationships that make events successful? Are you hoping for a big career breakthrough in a company that is growing fiercely while also allowing you to focus on your own professional growth?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk we are looking for a driven and energetic event marketer to drive, develop and manage our growing calendar of global third party conferences in order to increase Snyk’s brand awareness, foster lead engagements, and create new sales opportunities. You’ll work closely across the marketing, DevRel, sales, and business development teams to help to identify the best tradeshows and conferences for Snyk around the world; manage the pre, during and post event planning; rethink how to make both virtual and in person events compelling; and report out regularly on business results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Execute event experiences</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> end-to-end with an "on-time, on-strategy, on-budget" mentality and a hands-on approach.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Getting creative. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will craft strategic event experiences that differentiate Snyk and ensure direct buyer connections, that are aligned to an overall marketing campaign strategy and in collaboration with our campaign marketers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aligning with field marketing: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closely align with our ABM and field teams to ensure outbound tactics are integrated with events as part of broader campaigns.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Planning, budgeting, measuring, and ROIing.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’ll be in control of each campaign’s plans, budgeting, goal setting for both lead and pipeline generation, and tracking towards the goals.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Scaling Snyk-hosted events. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering closely with the Event Marketing Director, you’ll execute against many components of SnykCon and other Snyk-hosted events.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ideating. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We strive to be the best marketing team the tech space has seen. We would like your help in ideating (and then executing) new, other activities we should bring into the fold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we <a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a> in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
