<p><strong>Community Outreach Program: Internships for underrepresented groups&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>As part of Snyk’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, we are launching a 3 month (minimum) internship program aimed at supporting some of the most disproportionately impacted groups following Covid as they make the jump out of education and into the workplace.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an enthusiastic Sales Apprentice to join our Sales Development Representative (SDR) team where sales training is the focus, professional development is the obsession, and the pipeline generation activities are the driving force behind incremental revenue growth for our Sales organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sales Development team is an integral member of our global go to market strategy - assisting with tactical account planning, new client prospecting and expanding our partnership with existing Snyk customers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please apply below! We care deeply about the warm, inclusive environment we’ve created and we value diversity.&nbsp; We’ve designed these internships to support some of the groups most impacted by Covid, so this role is specifically for women and underrepresented ethnic groups who have/will graduate in 2019/2020 and are preparing to transition out of education and into full time employment.</span></p>
<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the digital world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living through a wave of digital transformation that is making every industry a software-development industry from financial services, to media and entertainment, to moving, from travel and e-commerce, to healthcare and banking: our data is becoming digital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By September 2020, Snyk was already adopted by over 1.5M developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). Our September 2020 Series D funding round of $200M has put us at over $2.5Billion company valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
