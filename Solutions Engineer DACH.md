<p><strong>Location: Germany/DACH (Remote)</strong></p>
<p>We're looking for a driven, user-focused Sales Engineer to interface between our customers (new and current) and our Product Engineering teams, both supporting adoption of Snyk in new organisations and helping to evolve what Snyk has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>You'll Spend Your Time:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Becoming a technical product expert, evangelist and coach, able to give technical sales demonstrations to customer and partners in your sleep.</li>
<li>Educate customer and partners about the adoption of open source and the importance of empowering developers to stay secure.</li>
<li>Drive the technical aspects of the sale, providing demonstrations, managing proof of concepts, demonstrating product expertise and sharing best practice.</li>
<li>Interfacing with our channel partners, Engineering, Product and Customer Success teams to build solutions that actually solve our customers' problems.</li>

</ul>
<p>We are distributed across four primary offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, whilst expanding into many new regions. We've made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others' perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what's happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</p>

<li>Your written and spoken English &amp; German is strong.</li>
