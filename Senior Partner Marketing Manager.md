<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p>Snyk's mission is to help companies develop fast and stay secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital transformation has driven companies in all industries to develop faster and adopt modern DevOps processes, modern cloud-native application structure, and an increased dependency on the software supply chain. Traditional application security tools have not been able to keep up. (<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofsecurity/" target="_blank">https://snyk.io/stateofsecurity/</a>). Snyk's unique developer-first approach to cloud native application security enables developers and enterprise security teams to build software securely throughout the software development lifecycle. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, and always focus on our customers and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of 2019, Snyk had adopted more than 450,000 developers, over 500 customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS, Intuit and others). We've also raised an additional $150 million, announced in January 2020, to enable us to execute on our mission.&nbsp;</p>
