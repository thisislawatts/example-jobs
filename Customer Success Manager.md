<li>working with the sales team to support successful customer renewals and account growth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>providing quarterly customer business reviews to each customer to demonstrate the value they are getting from Snyk.&nbsp;</li>
<li>gathering usage patterns, feature requests, and feedback then sharing these with the product team.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll be the main point of contact for the organisations you support, so you will need to be proactive in how you communicate, and responsive to incoming requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You Should Apply If:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<li>you are pragmatic, realistic, and you build strong, respectful relationships across levels of seniority both inside Snyk as well as the customer organisation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>you are comfortable with working through problems at a fast-growing company.&nbsp;</li>
<li>you have experience in customer success or customer-facing role, for a technical product or services company.&nbsp;</li>
<li>you are familiar with developer workflows and standard tooling e.g. GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, VScode.</li>
<li>you're interested in open source and security, cloud, and containers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>you're excited about what we do and want to help our customers gain more value from Snyk.&nbsp;</li>
