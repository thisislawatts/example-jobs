<p>We're looking for an organised, personable Customer Success Manager to help delight our customers by optimising their onboarding experience and driving adoption while helping them to accomplish their goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p>You will be responsible for helping our customers build value using Snyk's Open Source Security products for their company quickly and effectively. This includes taking them through the onboarding journey and helping them build value for their company by using Snyk. You'll build and maintain the long term relationship with the customer by advocating customer needs internally across departments like Product, Support, and Sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Being successful in this role involves:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>working with key technical stakeholders to agree on objectives and define success plans.&nbsp;</li>
<li>understanding each organisation's technical setup and workflow, and planning a rollout that suits their needs.</li>
<li>ensuring customers are getting the most out of the product and are adopting new features.&nbsp;</li>
<li>working with the sales team to support successful customer renewals and account growth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>providing quarterly customer business reviews to each customer to demonstrate the value they are getting from Snyk.</li>
<li>gathering usage patterns, feature requests, and feedback then sharing these with the product team.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll be the main point of contact for the organisations you support, so you will need to be proactive in how you communicate, and responsive to incoming requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You Should Apply If:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You ask incisive questions and are comfortable learning to discuss complex requirements.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You don't wait for an answer, you go and find one.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You're well organised, good at prioritising and juggling multiple work streams.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You are pragmatic, realistic, and you build strong, respectful relationships across levels of seniority both inside Snyk as well as the customer organisation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You are comfortable with working through problems at a fast-growing company.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You have experience in customer success or customer-facing role, for a technical product or services company.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You are familiar with developer workflows and standard tooling e.g. GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, VScode.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You're interested in open source and security, cloud, and containers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You're excited about what we do and want to help our customers gain more value from Snyk.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interested?</strong></p>
<p>Please apply below! We're a fast growing company, with lots of opportunities to take on additional responsibility and to improve and shape processes. We care deeply about the warm, inclusive environment we've created and we value diversity - we welcome applications from those typically underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role, but are not totally sure whether you're the right person, do apply anyway.</p>
<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to help organisations use open source software and stay secure. Well over 300,000 developers have adopted Snyk as part of their workflow, and we have over 400,000 projects and over 1m patches, with a series of top brand customers on board (including Google, Skyscanner and ASOS), and a large and ever-growing stream of incoming requests to buy Snyk Enterprise. We recently secured our Series B funding round of $22m, bringing us to a total of $102m funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're focused on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities as they develop, and to help security and governance teams understand their status and drive improvement. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</p>
