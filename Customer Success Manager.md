<p><strong>Customer Success Manager</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Remote</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We're looking for an organised and personable Customer Success Manager to help delight our customers by optimising their onboarding experience and driving adoption while helping them to accomplish their goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be responsible for helping our customers build value using Snyk's Open Source Security products for their company quickly and effectively. This includes taking them through the onboarding journey and helping them build value for their company by using Snyk. You'll build and maintain the long term relationship with the customer by advocating customer needs internally across departments like Product, Support, and Sales.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with key technical stakeholders to agree on objectives and define success plans.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding each organisation's technical setup and workflow, and planning a rollout that suits their needs.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensuring customers are getting the most out of the product and are adopting new features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with the sales team to support successful customer renewals and account growth.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing quarterly customer business reviews to each customer to demonstrate the value they are getting from Snyk.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gathering usage patterns, feature requests, and feedback then sharing these with the product team.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll be the main point of contact for the organisations you support, so you will need to be proactive in how you communicate, and responsive to incoming requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you ask incisive questions and are comfortable learning to discuss complex requirements.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don't wait for an answer, you go and find one.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you're well organised, good at prioritising and juggling multiple work streams.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you are pragmatic, realistic, and you build strong, respectful relationships across levels of seniority both inside Snyk as well as the customer organisation.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you are comfortable with working through problems at a fast-growing company.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you have experience in customer success or customer-facing role, for a technical product or services company.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you are familiar with developer workflows and standard tooling e.g. GitHub, Jira, Jenkins, VScode.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you're interested in open source and security, cloud, and containers.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you're excited about what we do and want to help our customers gain more value from Snyk.</span></li>
