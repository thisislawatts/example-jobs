<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p>Weâ€™re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snykâ€™s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</p>
<p>In March of 2021, we&nbsp;<a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a>&nbsp;in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and weâ€™re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe open source software is a force for good, and weâ€™re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who arenâ€™t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</p>
