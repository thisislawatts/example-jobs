We care deeply about the warm, inclusive environment we’ve created and we value diversity.&nbsp; We’ve designed these internships to support some of the groups most impacted by Covid, so this role is specifically for women and underrepresented ethnic groups who have/will graduate in 2019/2020 and are preparing to transition out of education and into full time employment.</span></p>
<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the digital world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living through a wave of digital transformation that is making every industry a software-development industry from financial services, to media and entertainment, to moving, from travel and e-commerce, to healthcare and banking: our data is becoming digital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By September 2020, Snyk was already adopted by over 1.5M developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). Our September 2020 Series D funding round of $200M has put us at over $2.5Billion company valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
