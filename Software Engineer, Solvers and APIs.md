<p>We’re looking for a software engineer with an algorithmic background to build the next generation of Datalog solvers. This solver is the core part of Snyk’s DeepCode Engine: the most advanced platform for semantic code analysis over BigCode.</p>
<p><strong>The team is focused on</strong> <strong>solving challenges including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>creating real-time high-precision analyzer based on logical reasoning and machine learning</li>
<li>utilizing ML and program analysis results over extremely large learning date sets</li>
<li>automatically creating training data sets</li>
<li>advancing the technology and research for high precision real-time program analysis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>developing algorithms that analyze millions of lines of code in<br>seconds</li>
<li>writing compilers that transform a huge state-of-the-art knowledge base of program facts into executable code</li>
<li>creating distributed systems that use these algorithms to build SaaS applications, delivering real-time result to developers around the world</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>have an advanced degree, with excellent grades, in the area of machine learning from a top university. Ideally with focus on using software code as semantic data and synthesis</li>

<li>love working in a fast-paced start-up environment that respects its engineers and customers</li>
<li>prioritise collaboration, pair programming, and code review</li>
<li>work sustainably, quickly, and iteratively</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we <a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a> in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
