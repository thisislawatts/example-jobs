<p><strong>Software Engineer, Developer Experience</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk we care deeply about our developer experience and productivity. It requires constant innovation as we increase our product breadth and depth, and scale our footprint globally to enable millions of external developers through our security products, all while maintaining high availability and reliability of our platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a software engineer who is passionate about DevOps, Cloud Native Infrastructure, and enabling their fellow engineers by paving a road for teams to ship continuously and reliably to Production. For Snyk, Production covers a multi-cluster, multi-region design across a range of deployment options: Multi-tenant SaaS, Single-tenant SaaS, and On Prem solutions. There is a huge opportunity to innovate in the delivery and release engineering aspects of targeting many environments on each code push!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be joining the Developer Experience team whose focus is to accelerate fellow engineers to ship code quickly, reliably, and with minimum cognitive overhead. You will work closely with the Cloud Platforms and SRE teams within the Infra Group. Snyk is a fast-growing business with close to 200 engineers. We are set to nearly double that in the next year!</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will work with colleagues across all of R&amp;D to deliver new capabilities with all of the necessary ingredients to drive adoption – consultancy, advocacy, training, and documentation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hands on building of platform capabilities and products, and the integration of vendor software into the Snyk SDLC.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will give teams the tools and insights so that they can make local changes to drive more efficient flow. Currently we are using CodeClimate Velocity and would welcome more ideas on how to capture insights and derive actions for acceleration and high performance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working cross-functionally with Snyk’s R&amp;D teams to help them make best use of the Developer Experience “paved road”. Capturing feedback and requirements to feed into your team’s planning and backlog.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being involved in the day-to-day Agile practices of the team, striving for predictable and repeatable success.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instrumenting the KPIs and metrics around delivery performance and quality for R&amp;D into our CI/CD pipelines. Correlated success for this team would be to observe KPIs improving at a team and group level across R&amp;D through the tooling and consultancy provided by your team.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have hands-on experience as a software engineer or infrastructure engineer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have worked in a team with a focus on customer acquisition, product adoption, and education. Can be either an internally or externally facing set of customers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An excellent ability to empathise with your customers, which are happily other engineers. You are energised by helping teams and organisations accelerate through consultancy, tooling adoption, and education.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate proactively, are comfortable working across departments and teams to build bridges and create valuable feedback loops into your team’s plans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience building and maintaining automation tooling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are willing to inspect and change the status quo – to discover fresh ideas on how infrastructure is built, delivered, and operated at scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have worked in a similar team/domain before where enabling internal teams was the core focus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience of working in a geographically distributed team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience of working with multiple cloud providers, CI/CD tools, and delivery metrics platforms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience of working in both software engineer and cloud infrastructure roles.</span></li>
</ul>
