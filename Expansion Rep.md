<p><strong>We’re looking for a driven Expansion Sales Rep to collaborate closely with both our Core Sales team &amp; Customer Success, identifying upsell opportunities in our existing client base and maintaining lasting relationships with our customers.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source software is growing rapidly: technology is a core part of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t security experts</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But our team is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a developer tooling company with deep security knowledge: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Expansion Rep for Snyk, you’ll work closely with our Customer Success &amp; Core Sales teams to identify new opportunities to expand Snyk usage within our existing clients. Our current customer base ranges from mid-market companies who like to move fast right up to slow burn large enterprises like Google, Netflix and Salesforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want you to contribute to the iterative improvement of our sales process, tone and approach, and you’ll have plenty of scope to inform the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a collaborative team from a variety of backgrounds, made up of sales executives and technical sales engineers.  We spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team.    </span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building strong relationships with our existing client base (giving extra attention to those clients who haven’t heard from us in a while)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mapping out how these organisations work: identifying how departments and teams interact, the internal processes for getting things done, and understanding how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within the org.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a product expert for the new features and products our engineering teams release, and introducing these to existing clients </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborating closely with our core Sales Reps and our Customer Success team to identify new upselling opportunities with existing clients</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience managing multiple accounts and maintaining strong, positive relationships with existing clients</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand the software developer lifecycle and can articulate how a developer tooling product might fit in</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a track record of identifying and executing on upsell opportunities in existing deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand people: what makes them tick, what their attitude is to us, when they’re most likely to want to buy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re organised, rigorous, and love to improve processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a startup on its way to success </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced, collaborative teams</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We'd love to hear from you!</span></p>
