<p><strong>We’re looking for an experienced leader and manager to collaborate closely with both our Core Sales team &amp; Customer Success, identifying account risk as well as the upsell opportunities in our existing client base and maintaining lasting relationships with our customers.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source software is growing rapidly: technology is a core part of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t security experts</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But our team is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a developer tooling company with deep security knowledge: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Manager of Account Management (Renewals) will be responsible for leading and managing a growing team of Renewal Representatives in EMEA, whose responsibilities range from the commercial renewal of SMB all the way up to the Enterprise customers. The Manager will work cross-collaboratively to identify areas of commercial risk as well as areas of expansion within the customer install base. This is done by partnering with all facets of the go-to-market org with an emphasis on alignment between both the leadership of Customer Success as well as Sales Management. This role is strategically important to the business in terms of driving world-class SaaS renewal rates as well as the growth and scale of this department. We’re looking for a driven, best-in-class Renewals Manager, to up-level the renewal performance throughout EMEA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want you to contribute to the iterative style of our customer journey throughout the sales and renewal process along with,&nbsp; enabling you to inform the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a collaborative team from a variety of backgrounds, made up of sales executives and technical sales engineers.&nbsp; We spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forecasting the renewal rates in quarter as well as the out quarters to upper management and members of the executive team on a weekly basis.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborating closely with our core Sales Management and our Leaders in the Customer Success org to identify new upselling opportunities</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join customer calls to help Renewal Reps close business when additional and high level involvement is necessary</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience managing 6+ reps at a given time, ranging from entry level to senior renewal roles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have performed above and beyond in terms of retention rates and expansion of customers under a rapidly evolving and fast-paced environment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand the software developer lifecycle and can articulate how a developer tooling product might fit in</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a track record of identifying and executing on remediation plans when a renewal is in jeopardy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand people: what makes them tick, what their attitude is to us, when they’re most likely to want to buy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re organised, rigorous, and love to improve processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a hyper growth company on its way to success</span></li>
