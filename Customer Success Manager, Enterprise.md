<p><strong>Our mission is to help organizations use open source software and stay secure.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well over 300,000 developers have adopted Snyk as part of their workflow, and we have over 400,000 projects and over 1m patches, with a series of top brand customers on board (including Google, Skyscanner and Asos), and a large and ever-growing stream of incoming requests to buy Snyk Enterprise.

We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
