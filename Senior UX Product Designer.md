<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an exceptional UX designer to join our global design team, to create compelling user experiences that developers will love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the senior UX designer you’ll play an important role in achieving Snyk’s mission of helping software developers use open source and containers securely.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on complex design problems, in a complicated domain</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquiring strong actionable insight through research and usability testing, iterating on the design and flows based on this feedback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborating cross-functionally with product management, engineering, and marketing to ensure a smooth product design process and consistent visual language.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delivering artifacts to a high level of attention to detail and craft&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining and evolving our design system, in collaboration with our engineers, to ensure the UI is consistently implemented across our portfolio</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping to establish world class design practices and a strong design culture</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum of 5 years commercial design experience</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have plenty of experience running usability testing sessions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can demonstrate work process methodology including user workflows, wireframes/mockups and design explorations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are agile and enjoy the speed of a fast-paced, highly engaged startup environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have flawless written English, and you're confident running customer-facing communications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are hands-on, curious and love to explore new domains and technologies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critical thinker prepared to challenge the status quo</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience of designing for (or working as a developer) the software development life cycle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience working with distributed, agile teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can demonstrate experience in working from vague briefs, working through a robust process to deliver high quality, design artefacts</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>About Snyk</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps, and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston, and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,00 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity, and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
