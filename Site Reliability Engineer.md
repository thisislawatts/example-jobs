<p><strong>We’re looking for a  site reliability engineer to join our Infrastructure team to maintain and improve Snyk’s ability to safely and rapidly grow our core product.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Infrastructure team owns the tooling that Snyk uses to build and operate our platform reliably, at scale, and under continuous change. Snyk has a strong devops culture: the people that build the software, run the software. The infra team was formed in early 2019 to ensure our operational capabilities and tooling remain fit for purpose as we grow. This year the team has drastically increased our system observability, resolved a number of reliability issues at a system pinch points using custom autoscaling, increased quality-of-service guarantees without increasing costs through better capacity planning and intelligent resource allocation, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled our CI/CD tooling.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to use your past operations experience to focus on the core of a problem through metrics, collaborating with your team to make sure the Snyk service reliably meets our customers’ needs. Here at Snyk, you’ll be involved in building useful tools, working with customers running Snyk on their own infrastructure, and helping to move the field of application security forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying software engineering approaches to classic operations problems.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving the reliability of Snyk’s platform and product.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building, maintaining and continually improving the tools that we use to deploy and operate the software that we build. This includes automated build and deployment, secrets management, system observability, monitoring, log aggregation, scaling, and more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with Snyk’s product teams to help them make best use of the platform’s capabilities, and identifying and driving the build-out of new capabilities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interacting with technical staff at our on-premise customers to troubleshoot issues they face, and using that experience to mature and improve our on-premises deployment tooling.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe that devops is an outcome, not a role.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have hands-on experience as a site reliability engineer or similar.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience building and maintaining devops automation and tooling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate proactively, and enjoy working with people from multiple disciplines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have seen good (and bad) infrastructure, and have opinions about what works and what doesn’t</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are hands-on, curious and love to explore new domains, technologies, and approaches.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are agile and enjoy the speed of a fast-paced, highly engaged startup environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience running software on Kubernetes (or similar).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience making data-driven infrastructure decisions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like to automate things as much as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have some programming experience.</span></li>
</ul>
