<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a curious, analytical and detail-oriented Security Data Analyst to join our team and help us uncover unknown vulnerabilities that exist in open source.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, much of any project's code relies on open source packages. These are out there in the world, visible for anyone, and within that code there are vulnerabilities. As part of our security team, you'll join us on our mission to continually improve our ability to find these open source vulnerabilities in a programmatic way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll join our interdisciplinary security team, alongside fully dedicated engineers focussed on building tools that make your work more effective and have lots of opportunities to learn and grow. This role is particularly well-suited to help you develop a deep understanding of how code works, and over time you'll have the opportunity to work with just about every programming language.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Triaging and analysing potential vulnerabilities discovered within open-source dependencies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further researching known vulnerabilities to determine characteristics such as severity and exploitability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using research to verify or disqualify potential vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building data models and structures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using data analyst techniques to answer research questions about vulnerabilities, and general threat intelligence trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training machine learning models to find where vulnerabilities are mostly likely to lie, using a combination of our unique database of verified known vulns; information about how the open source community operates; and the static code itself</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing and testing theories and hypotheses around new areas that Snyk tackles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop our product to further achieve our mission</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You're comfortable working with large datasets (we use BigQuery; ideally you'll have used one of BigQuery, elasticsearch, kibana, hadoop etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a passion for security and an interest in the problem space</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve triaged and analysed data before using techniques and tools such as pandas and jupyter</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience using statistical tools to help answer research questions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to automate your work, through writing your own scripts (we use Python and JavaScript)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love learning new techniques and getting experience in new fields</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have previous experience working with open source codebases</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have worked with researchers before, ideally in the security space or have conducted security research yourself</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience PoCing vulnerabilities and dealing with vulnerability disclosures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have worked closely with Data Scientists in the past and have experience working with ML</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,00 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
