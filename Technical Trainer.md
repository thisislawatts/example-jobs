<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation. Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and the demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has been adopted by over 2.2M developers who use Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we raised $300M in Series E funding, bringing our company valuation to&nbsp; $4.7 billion, after recently securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions with DeepCode &amp; Manifold. On top of that, we have doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
<h4><strong>What does our interview process look like?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start by having a video call to get to know you. We’ll tell you more about us, what we’re up to on our different teams, and why our culture is so great! We also want to hear about you, your skills and experience, and why you are interested in exploring Snyk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up we’ll provide an opportunity for you to train us on a technical topic of your choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there you’ll meet with a few members of our team, so you can find out everything you need to know about the way we work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
