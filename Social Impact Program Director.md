<p>Are you passionate about Social Impact, and the opportunity for companies to build positive impact into their business model?&nbsp; Do you love the challenge of building up and scaling global programs in growing organisations? Do you have a vision for how Impact can be woven into the very fabric of business operations?&nbsp; Do you enjoy context switching between strategic visioning and tactical execution?</p>
<p>At Snyk we are seeking a strategic Impact leader to lead our Social Impact program as we continue to build upon our Impact strategy. Reporting to the Chief People Officer and working closely with our executives across all business lines, the Head of Social Impact will be spearheading Snyk’s Impact strategy and direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social Impact at Snyk:</strong> Snyk has experienced tremendous success and growth over the last few years, and as part of our values that go to the very core of who we are, we believe strongly in our responsibility to have positive social and environmental impact as we grow. Our Impact program is not just about philanthropy and giving back (although this is important); it is embedded into our overall business operations so that the success of our Impact initiatives inherently feeds into the success of the company as a whole. Snyk has ambitious goals in this area and we are looking for a head of Impact to lead and drive these forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Role mission:</strong> This role will be responsible for leading and building upon Snyk’s social impact strategy across our three major impact pillars - DEI in the developer community, digital security across the nonprofit space, and environmental sustainability.&nbsp; While we anticipate that the impact team will grow in the future commensurate with the program success, at this stage this is an individual contributor position focused on both strategy and execution.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Program leadership</strong>: Collaborate closely with other functions and key leadership stakeholders to define program strategy and priorities, and execute against these in partnership with the relevant stakeholders</li>
<li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> Build and curate a global network of key nonprofit partners to accelerate the scale of the impact program</li>
<li><strong>DEI &amp; Volunteerism</strong>: Partner closely with our heads of employee DEI and our program manager for employee volunteerism to build a cohesive program together that encompasses all Impact spaces</li>
<li><strong>Funding &amp; Governance</strong>: Establish a clear governance model that enables a global view to prioritization of efforts, investments and funding.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting and transparency</strong>: Build mechanisms for reporting and measurement that render transparency and accountability across the program</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A demonstrated passion for Impact; experience spearheading initiatives directly tied to positive social and/or environmental impact</li>
<li>8+ years demonstrated experience collaborating closely with global stakeholders in large scaling global organizations</li>
<li>Have led corporate responsibility programs in multiple countries</li>
<li>is/have been responsible for making critical decisions on budget</li>
