<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our mission is to help organizations use open source software and stay secure.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well over 300,000 developers have adopted Snyk as part of their workflow, we have a series of top brand customers on board (including Google, Skyscanner and Asos), and a large and ever-growing stream of incoming requests to buy Snyk Enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re focused on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities as they develop, and to help security and governance teams understand their status and drive improvement. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organizations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split evenly between London and Tel Aviv. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
