<p><strong>Internal Communications Lead</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a creative, organised Communications Lead to join our People Enablement team to help get the right information to the right people at the right time. You’ll partner with senior leaders across the business to find the most compelling ways to communicate with our people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People Enablement team is a new team which focuses on three areas: organizational development, communications and learning &amp; development. This year the team has piloted manager development programmes, defined our communication etiquette in Slack, and begun building an organization-wide induction programme. You’ll know how to establish an internal communications presence, and use that to unify and enable our people with information.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing and implementing Snyk’s communication strategy</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting our Executive Team to plan and craft compelling communications before, during and after major business milestones or change implementation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use communications as a means of connecting our people to our leadership, organizational strategy, business growth and change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive improvements to our intranet / wiki to ensure people have access to the right information, including creating content and driving best practices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan or co-ordinate events (both virtual and in-person) which bring our people together. Some of these will be small and intimate, others will be department or company-wide).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying pain points with how we communicate with each other across the business and forming &amp; delivering on strategies to improve this.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have 4+ years experience of delivering internal communications, some of which has been spent in a fast-paced, high-growth business which uses Slack, rather than email.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience of planning communications globally with input from multiple stakeholders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have strong copywriting and content creation skills which you’ve used to communicate to a largely technical audience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience of designing high-impact virtual and in-person events, big and small</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience of creating useful, practical content such as intranet pages and other resources</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we <a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a> in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
