<p><strong>We are looking for a curious, capable developer to join one of our engineering teams and help us build our core<a href="https://snyk.io/test"> product</a>.</strong></p>

We believe that </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">done</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is better than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfect</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Most of the time you will be coding. Every so often (around 2-3 months) you will also be working with developers from other teams as part of a shared weekly on-call rotation, keeping our production system healthy and gaining a better understanding of our customer needs; you will work with two or three other developers at a time. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding and building features on ad-hoc, cross-functional feature teams </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace in two-week sprints </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking part in maintaining and supporting our service</span></li>

</ul>
<h2><strong>More about our developers’ skills and what our teams do</strong></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tech Stack</strong> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe in selecting the right tools for the job but we mostly work in JavaScript both front-end and back-end, and our architecture follows the microservices pattern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current stack consists of: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NodeJS, JavaScript, Vue.js, TypeScript, jQuery, Express, Postgresql, SQL, Sass, BEM, CSS, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Docker, Fractal, Kibana, Elasticsearch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are looking for candidates with existing experience with our tech stack we believe curiosity, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">communication, and the ability to learn are most important.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Teams</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment the following teams are looking for software developers:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Languages</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Languages team is responsible for introducing support for new languages, build tools, and package managers to help Snyk users test and fix their projects. The team’s number one challenge is improving performance for users with a huge amount of dependencies (some may have up to 100,000!). They do this through experimenting with different data structures and algorithms, and introducing architectural changes to existing models to support new tools. On this team, developers work incredibly collaboratively with each other, and are open to unfamiliar tools and learning something new everyday.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Enterprise Governance </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise Governance provides high-level insights and tools for our customers’ senior stakeholders (CSOs). There are many ways Enterprise Governance helps CSOs do this, including helping them define policies and enabling them to check, at a glance, how their security vulnerabilities are reducing over time. Tackling problems such as keeping reporting fast whilst also handling millions of rows of analytics data a day, Enterprise Governance is looking for developers who have worked with large datasets, and those who have experience working with a number of different database technologies, ideally BigQuery.</span></p>
<h2><strong>About Snyk</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. Our service enables developers and security teams to continuously find and fix open source security vulnerabilities without slowing down, seamlessly integrating into Dev &amp; DevOps workflows. We are committed to ensuring you stay safe while working freely with the open-source libraries you love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have more than 300,000 developers using Snyk globally with great enterprise customers on board (including Google, Netflix and New Relic). We also recently raised $10m from top VC firms (including Accel and Google Ventures) - we’re experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Interested?</strong></h2>
