<p><strong>Account Director</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Singapore</strong></p>
<p>We’re looking for a collaborative, and driven Account Director with a track record in over-achieving your quotas especially in Hong Kong &amp; Taiwan or South Korea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an Account Director at Snyk, you’ll be responsible for the end-to-end sales cycle for prospective customers, taking warm inbound leads, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders in the DevSecOps space and digital transformation teams at companies. Our existing customer base ranges from mid-market companies to large enterprises like Google and Salesforce.</p>
<p>We want you to contribute to the iterative improvement of our sales process, tone and approach, and you’ll have plenty of scope to contribute to the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively. We’re a collaborative team with different experiences, and we spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team.</p>

<li>are self-motivated and hard-working</li>
<li>constantly exceed your quota, and you enjoy and thrive working in fast-paced environments</li>
<li>are collaborative with marketing, sales engineers, product, customer success, and others to get your deal done, and work well in a “teaming” environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>are resilient: you believe mistakes and failures are learning opportunities, and you value feedback</li>
<li>are open, honest and take an entrepreneurial approach to sales, and mindful of your customer’s risk tolerance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
