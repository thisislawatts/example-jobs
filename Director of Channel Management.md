<p>We’re looking for an entrepreneurial, driven and analytical channel development professional to establish and build out the Snyk channel partner program from scratch.</p>
<p>The use of open source software is booming: technology is integral to almost every facet of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact"> <em>aren’t security experts</em></a>. As a developer tooling company with deep security knowledge, we’re particularly well-positioned to solve this problem.</p>
<p>We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and we’ve already secured some great<a href="https://snyk.io/partners"> partners</a>. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</p>
<h2>Your role</h2>
<p>As our first channel manager, you’ll fundamentally shape the way in which channel is built at Snyk.</p>
<p>You’ll be responsible for building out a successful channel program from scratch: identifying the best first geography, market and channel type and prove out a model. You will be expected to bundle our solution with other dev or security tools, resell via VARs or MSSPs, or integrate into cloud and digital transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>In this role you will establish the first channel relationships with new partners that you bring, and you'll build a model of those relationships that can scale. Once this is proven, you will build out a team to continue executing on this model, which will carry a significant portion of the company’s revenue goals. This role reports to the VP Sales.</p>
<p>Among other things, you’ll spend your time:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">understanding how to make channel work for Snyk</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">market mapping and exploring various channel strategies for the company</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">signing up first channel partners on the program</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">structuring and defining program KPIs, training, marketing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">modeling out what you need in order to scale program - both people and resources</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">executing with partners in collaboration with our sales team to get deals and revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll give you the freedom you need to thrive, including defining and achieving ambitious goals. Your work will influence our long-term growth and the scope of our future success.</p>
<h2>You should join us if:</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You have direct experience in channel development and scaling, specifically in the software security space</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You have background in software security, open source, devops, cloud or dev tooling space</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You build meaningful relationships and love to find mutually beneficial opportunities</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You understand how large and small channel partners work, and how as a startup we can best partner with them</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You are process-oriented and can build a program that others can follow and iterate on</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You are open, honest, outcome-driven and take an entrepreneurial approach</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You’re excited about the opportunity to build an effective, impactful channel program from scratch!</li>
</ul>
