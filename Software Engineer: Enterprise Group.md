<p><strong><u>Currently, this role is on hold.  We’re expecting to be hiring for this role later this year, so if you’re interested in being contacted when we start the hiring process, please apply for the position and we’ll be in touch as soon as we can.</u></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a delivery-oriented, experienced software engineer to join one of our core product teams to help our enterprise customers adopt open source and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams on the Enterprise Group aim to solve challenges encountered by the CISO of a large enterprise, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onboarding large developer teams onto our multi-tenant SaaS offering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing and reporting on a large count of applications developed within the enterprise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying policies that ease security compliance as an integral part of the software development lifecycle process</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure and enhance the engagement and adoption of our service by individual developers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the teams will extend our ability to onboard customers 100x times larger than our current biggest, develop workflows in the product to match the challenges such enterprises are facing, and ensure proper engagement and adoption of these features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to develop modern full-stack web applications. You’ll use that knowledge to understand the business priorities, participate in feature design and incremental delivery of a SaaS application in a full CI/CD workflow. Here at Snyk, you’ll use your passion as a developer to combine your problem solving skills with your desire to work on the right problems! </span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning the development process of specific features in our SaaS offering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaging in problem analysis and collaborating with the product team to create feature plans that outline implementation details</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coding and building features on ad-hoc, cross-functional feature teams </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace, in two-week sprints </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking part in maintaining and supporting our service during our oncall rotation (for a week every 10 weeks)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience working on a SaaS web application</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe testing and code quality are important, and prioritize useful code review</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like to move quickly and iteratively, and believe that shipping early is best</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are comfortable with Git, GitHub and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment workflows</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are proactive, and enjoy working on cross-functional delivery teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like to start new things, see them through to production, and learn from your mistakes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are interested in security, developer tooling, and open source</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,00 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
