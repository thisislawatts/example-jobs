Snyk is on a mission to secure the way people develop and consume open source. We analyse and protect your projects, eliminating known vulnerabilities and securing applications in runtime.

Developers care a lot about security, but currently have too few options to actually do something about it. We make security an aspect of quality, built into the software from the beginning.

We have a mature product for npm and the NodeJS ecosystem, now expanding into Ruby, Java and more. Our tech stack starts with JavaScript and NodeJS. Redis, Postgres AWS/Google Cloud and microservices play their roles in our back-end architecture.

Our DevOps stack includes CI/CD with GitHub, Travis, Docker and Kubernetes.

We run a distributed team between our London and Tel Aviv offices. We communicate over Slack and zoom.us more than we rely on email. Any process we want to adopt manifests in a Slack integration keeping everyone informed. Jira helps us manage our two-week sprints, and helps us run our daily standup meetings. Analytics with Keen IO and Mixpanel show us how we are doing with our users. Intercom.io keeps us in touch with them.

You are welcome to apply to our single-digit person team. Working well with a small group of people is as important as tech savvyness, if not more!
