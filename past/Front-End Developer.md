We are looking for a full time Front-End Developer to join our engineering team in London.

In this role, you will be supporting our lead Front-End Developer. You will be part of an engineering team that works in two-weeks' sprints.

## Responsibilities
 
**Work closely with our Product Designer to improve our web app**

We’re always adding new features to Snyk. You’ll be working with our Product Designer and our lead Front-End Developer in London to update and build new interfaces and user flows, such as when we add a new language or integration.
 
**Work on our marketing pages, email campaigns and vulnerability alerts**

Snyk includes our web app, CLI tool, marketing pages, email campaigns, new vulnerability alerts, and our integrations with other products. You’ll be putting together pages with our marketing team and making our emails more useful to our users. We know, building email templates isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s a key way we communicate with our users (such as alerting them to new vulnerabilities) and we want to make that experience as good as we can!
 
**Maintain our living design system**

We have a Fractal-based living design system, which is used by the whole engineering team. A core part of your role will be helping build upon and maintain this.
 
**Knowledge sharing**

We don’t like silos of knowledge (leaving us flailing when someone goes on holiday), so we encourage knowledge sharing – from writing great documentation for our team to demoing how to do something. We’d love someone who is as keen to learn as they are to teach.

**On-call duties**

Our engineering team shares a weekly oncall rotation (one person at a time). With 8 people on the team currently, you are expected to participate for a week every 2+ months. You will start your rotation with an experienced team member as your backup until you feel comfortable flying solo.

**Engage with our users**

While we have a dedicated customer success manager, everyone on the team chips in with customer support queries when they can. Doing this will help you understand our users better, and also identify where the product’s pain points are, so that you can help improve them. 
 
**Passion**

Not everyone is used to working on the same product over a long period of time, so it’s important that you feel as passionately as we do about Snyk. It helps that we’re continuously evolving and improving the product over time to keep it fresh, and it’s also a great personal learning opportunity to see what works over time and what doesn’t, and to leave your fingerprint on the product. We hope that you’ll never be bored by it, but that might be difficult if you don’t think open-source security is an exciting area to be working in (it makes us feel like superheroes!).

## How we like to code

We strive to write code in a way that is maintainable, componentized, and meets our users needs. We love code that is…
 
* **Secure:** As a security company, it’s important that we consider security in everything we build.
* **Accessible:** Snyk serves a wide range of users, and we strive to make our web app as accessible as we can.
* **Progressively enhanced:** We try not to rely too much on JavaScript, and where possible, we make our web app usable when it isn’t available.
* **Cross-browser and device agnostic:** We support and test on a range of devices and modern browsers.
* **Responsive:** People access Snyk on lots of different types of devices, so we make sure our site adapts to these.
* **Performant:** Performance is really important to our users, so we’re constantly optimising our code.
* **Testable:** We use a range of different tests to make sure we’re not shipping broken code, from E2E to visual regression tests.
* **Componentised, scaleable and maintainable:** We constantly tweak things, so building in a way that is easy to maintain, adapt and scale is really important. We believe that code shouldn’t just be easy to write, but also easy to delete.
* **Well documented:** Working in a distributed, growing team means documentation is really important. We write documentation for each component we build, and update it when the functionality changes.

## Skills & experience

### Required

* 2+ years of experience writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* A working knowledge Git for version control. We use GitHub extensively.
* Familiarity with using the CLI
* An understanding of how package managers and versioning works.
* Experience working in an agile environment.
* Experience with using templating (our design system uses Handlebars).
* Familiarity with building email templates.
* Some experience with working on or maintaining a design system.
* You need to be fluent in written and spoken English.
* As you’ll be working with people based in different locations and timezones, you’ll need excellent verbal and written communication skills.
* We need someone with a lot of self-initiative who strives for quality, but with a balance of pragmatism.

### Nice-to-have

You’ll blow our socks off if you have the following, but if not, don’t worry – we’ll give you all the training you’ll need to fill any gaps.
 
* We’re not looking for a designer for this role, but we’re keen to hire someone who is design literate.
* Experience working in a distributed team.
* Open source mindset
* Interest in security

Interested?

We’re eager to hear about you at jobs@snyk.io :)

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity.

### About [Snyk](https://snyk.io)

Open Source code, pulled from npm, Maven, RubyGems and others, is often the majority of code in an application, and yet it receives no security attention. Most developers do nothing to track known vulnerabilities in the packages they use, and trust this code as though it's their own. This risk is massive today, and is only made worse by the growing use of packages and the simplicity offered by package managers. It is further compounded by the fact that unpatched servers, which account for most successful exploits today, are slowly being abstracted away by PaaS and Serverless, making vulnerabilities in open source code packages become the easiest way in.

**At Snyk we believe this problem can only be fixed by developers and DevOps teams, being built into the way we create software.**
We offer a SaaS CI/CD and runtime monitoring product that helps organisations continuously find and fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down development.

**Snyk is a dev tooling company at heart.**
We care about securing the open source world itself as much as as we care about our enterprise-grade solution that lets large companies consume open source code while controlling risk. We operate at scale, with many thousands of users across both open source and enterprise. Snyk's client software has been downloaded over 1 million times, and we continuously protect over 10,000 open source repositories. We receive regular community contributions (and love!), have [great partners](https://snyk.io/partners) expanding our reach, and have more than 600 badges in GitHub championing us, including top projects like [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/) and [request](https://github.com/request/request/).

**Lastly, Snyk is a growth oriented venture backed company.** We raised a $3M seed round from US investors in October '15, and received another large infusion from our investors recently, demonstrating their excitement about our progress and potential.
Our team numbers 18 amazing people in two large offices in Tel Aviv & London, and a smaller presence in the US. We take a lot of care to keep a warm and inclusive environment, and make sure our distributed team gets plenty of face time over video and in trips.

To have a blast with us, it helps if:
* You like to both start new things and get them done
* You care about the impact you have on the end user
* You want to advance the way people develop software (did we say 'open source' yet?)
* You wish to share the way you do things and not just the end result
* You appreciate learning and helping others learn
