We're looking for a hands-on Product Marketing professional who can lead our marketing and demand generation activities.

**Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.** Snyk’s product enables developers and enterprise security to continuously find & fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, with seamless integration into Dev & DevOps workflows. The use of open source is booming, but [security is a key concern](https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/).

Snyk is adopted by over 120,000 developers, has multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others) and is experiencing rapid growth.

### Your role
You'll be our first dedicated marketer and will take ownership of all our marketing activities.

We need to communicate the criticality of open source security, and how Snyk can help address it: both for enterprise buyers, the open source community, and individual developers. Defining this messaging, and building collateral and campaigns to communicate it across all channels, will be a key part of your role.

You'll be responsible for:
* creating an efficient marketing funnel that capitalises on our bottom-up interest
* supporting our fast-growing enterprise sales team, including demand generation, lead nurturing, and lead scoring
* implementing personalised marketing automation to generate sales leads
* working with the sales team on lead scoring and handoff processes
* owning our messaging across channels
* establishing a relationship with a PR agency
* managing our participation at events
We expect you to define your strategy and what success looks like, as well as what other activities we should take on in order to market effectively. You will work closely with sales, product management, design and developer advocacy. 

While you'll be hands-on executing when you first join us, over time we expect you to build and lead a world-class marketing function.

### You should apply if:
* You have led marketing for at least two different products
* You know how to market to large enterprises
* You've optimised online self-serve conversion funnels
* You're proud of your content creation and communication skills
* You enjoy working closely with sales and technical product teams
* You're excited about building out the marketing function at Snyk
We'd particularly love to hear from you if you're passionate about security or open source, and you have experience of the developer and devops ecosystem, however this isn't required - we're happy to get you up to speed.

### Interested?
Please apply [here](https://grnh.se/bku4usty2).

We value diversity at Snyk, and would particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role, but are not totally sure whether you’re the right person, we'd encourage you to apply anyway!
