<img src="https://snyk.io/images/snyk-dog.png" width="100" alt="Snyk logo" />

**We are looking for a senior product designer, based in one of our main offices in London or Tel Aviv.**

We're looking for a full time Product Designer who can work closely with our excellent team and users to translate this vision into an intuitive, effective product that developers love to use.
In this role, you will own all design aspects of the Snyk product from creating UX mockups and customer user testing to implementing and maintaining our design components, working closely with Product and Dev.
You will also work closely with customers, sales and marketing, making sure the design answers the customers' real needs and is aligned with Snyk's overall positioning and design language. You will be reporting directly to the VP of Product Management.

### Responsibilities

#### Oversee the UX and visual design of Snyk

Snyk isn’t just a CLI tool – it includes our web app, marketing pages, email campaigns, new vulnerability alerts, and our integrations with other products. We’re looking for someone who can craft a seamless user flow – such as from getting a vulnerability alert in Slack, to reading a test report, to opening a Fix PR.

#### Organise and run user testing sessions

We like to test new features with real users and make improvements before releasing them. You’ll be in charge of making this happen.

#### Maintain our living design system

You’ll be working closely with our Front-end Developer to help build upon and maintain our Fractal-based living design system, which is used by the whole engineering team.

#### Improve our design process

We want to improve how we progress from the design discovery phase to shipping a new feature. We will look to you for guidance on how we can progress smoothly between different design and build phases.

#### Knowledge sharing

We don’t like silos of knowledge (leaving us flailing when someone goes on holiday), so we encourage knowledge sharing – from writing great documentation for our team to demoing how to do something. One of your responsibilities will be to help us collectively improve our design skills – not so that we can become designers, but so that we can keep things moving when you take time off.

#### Engage with our users

While we have a dedicated customer success manager, everyone on the team chips in with customer support queries when they can. Doing this will help you understand our users better, and also identify where the product’s pain points are, so that you can help improve them.

#### Passion

Not everyone is used to working on the same product over a long period of time, so it’s important that you feel as passionately as we do about Snyk. It helps that we’re continuously evolving and improving the product over time to keep it fresh, and it’s also a great personal learning opportunity to see what works over time and what doesn’t, and to leave your fingerprint on the product. We hope that you’ll never be bored by it, but that might be difficult if you don’t think open-source security is an exciting area to be working in (it makes us feel like superheroes!).

### Skills & experience

#### Required

We have a great team of engineers so we don’t expect you to write production code (unless you want to), but it helps if you have at least some knowledge of web development – not just to help in your day-to-day work, but also to understand our users better.

- 3+ years of designing web products.
- Comfortable writing HTML and CSS to maintain and create new components in our living design system.
- Experience working on a B2B product aimed at technical users.
- Experience with maintaining a design system.
- Whatever graphics software you use, we expect good layer etiquette – such as naming layers, and using groups and symbols to make it easy for the team to work with.
- We need someone with a lot of self-initiative who strives for quality, but with a balance of pragmatism.
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English. As you’ll be working with people based in different locations and timezones, you’ll need excellent verbal and written communication skills.
- Willingness to travel quarterly between our Tel Aviv and London offices

#### Nice-to-have

You’ll blow our socks off if you have the following, but if not, don’t worry – we’ll give you all the training you’ll need to fill any gaps.

- An understanding of Git (or using GitHub which we use extensively)
- JavaScript knowledge
- Experience with using Handlebars or similar for templating (our design system uses Handlebars)
- Familiarity with using the CLI
- An understanding of how package managers and versioning works
- Fondness of animals, especially dogs! (you will be looking at our dog logo a lot)

### About [Snyk](https://snyk.io)

Open Source code, pulled from npm, Maven, RubyGems and others, is often the majority of code in an application, and yet it receives no security attention. Most developers do nothing to track known vulnerabilities in the packages they use, and trust this code as though it's their own. This risk is massive today, and is only made worse by the growing use of packages and the simplicity offered by package managers. It is further compounded by the fact that unpatched servers, which account for most successful exploits today, are slowly being abstracted away by PaaS and Serverless, making vulnerabilities in open source code packages become the easiest way in.

**At Snyk we believe this problem can only be fixed by developers and DevOps teams, being built into the way we create software.**
We offer a SaaS CI/CD and runtime monitoring product that helps organisations continuously find and fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down development.

**Snyk is a dev tooling company at heart.**
We care about securing the open source world itself as much as as we care about our enterprise-grade solution that lets large companies consume open source code while controlling risk. We operate at scale, with many thousands of users across both open source and enterprise. Snyk's client software has been downloaded over 1 million times, and we continuously protect over 10,000 open source repositories. We receive regular community contributions (and love!), have [great partners](https://snyk.io/partners) expanding our reach, and have more than 600 badges in GitHub championing us, including top projects like [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/) and [request](https://github.com/request/request/).

**Lastly, Snyk is a growth oriented venture backed company.** We raised a $3M seed round from US investors in October '15, and received another large infusion from our investors recently, demonstrating their excitement about our progress and potential.
Our team numbers 18 amazing people in two large offices in Tel Aviv & London, and a smaller presence in the US. We take a lot of care to keep a warm and inclusive environment, and make sure our distributed team gets plenty of face time over video and in trips.

To have a blast with us, it helps if:
* You like to both start new things and get them done
* You care about the impact you have on the end user
* You want to advance the way people develop software (did we say 'open source' yet?)
* You wish to share the way you do things and not just the end result
* You appreciate learning and helping others learn
