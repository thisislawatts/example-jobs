<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mapping out how these organizations work: identifying how departments and teams interact, the internal processes for getting things done, and understanding how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within the org.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a product expert for the new features and products our engineering teams release, and introducing these to existing clients</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have 2+ years of closing experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand the software developer lifecycle and can articulate how a developer tooling product might fit in</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a track record of identifying and executing on upsell opportunities in existing deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand people: what makes them tick, what their attitude is to us, when they’re most likely to want to buy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re organized, rigorous, and love to improve processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a startup on its way to success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced, collaborative teams</span></li>
