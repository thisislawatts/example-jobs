<p><strong>Community Outreach Program: Internships for underrepresented groups&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Community Outreach internship program was first designed and launched during the pandemic, when we were particularly concerned the disproportionate economic impact of the pandemic on women and under-represented communities. We want to leverage the incredible growth and success we have experienced at Snyk to play our role in supporting under-represented minorities through opportunity and growth. The internship program allows minority groups with career opportunities while simultaneously aligning with our own talent growth strategy as a company.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Applications close on 15th October 2021.</strong></p>
