<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a passionate, hands-on developer advocate to join our Developer Relations team to educate, empower and enable developers in container security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Relations team collaborates closely with developers to raise awareness around the importance of security in the application lifecycle, educating them through content, engineering, presentations, videos, etc. about application security and pragmatic best practices they can use.</span></p>
<h2><strong>As a Container Developer Advocate at Snyk:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to apply good security practices to a container-based application, throughout the software development lifecycle. You’ll use that knowledge to help developers in the community learn more about application security and level up their application security practices.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing awareness around the Snyk platform</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educating open-source users and communities about the importance of DevSecOps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">producing great multimedia security content in a variety of different media : blog posts, videos, podcasts, cheat-sheets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being the public face of Snyk at conferences, community meetups and customer events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working closely together with our partners, customers, the development, product and marketing teams, and of course the broader developer communities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split evenly between London and Tel Aviv. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have previous development or DevOps experience in delivering a container-based application</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re passionate about the best practices of building security into application pipelines and are keen to share these with other developers and DevOps teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pride yourself on the quality and accessibility of your writing and teaching</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are comfortable preparing and presenting technical talks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are at your best when immersed around developers and their communities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about both container security and open-source software, and are excited about learning how to live-hack demo repos!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hands-on, curious and love to learn as well as educate</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have strong application security experience, or have worked with security engineers, including security leads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have had previous formal experience in developer advocacy</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will spend around a quarter of your time travelling, so will need to hold a valid passport at all times.</span></p>
