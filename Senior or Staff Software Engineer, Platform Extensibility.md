<p><strong><em>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country. Your regular workday must start </em></strong><strong><em>no earlier than 9AM UK and no later than 9AM US/Eastern.</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for empathetic, skilled, and practical senior or staff software engineers to help us craft tools, leverage standards, re-architect systems, and build key integrations for our API.</span></p>

We guide and facilitate the entire R&amp;D organization to move our current bespoke API into both OpenAPI 3.1 and GraphQL. We’re integrating new auth functionality, adding an Envoy-based API Gateway to our Kubernetes cluster, facilitating service extraction from our central monolith, and integrating all of this and more with some of the biggest names in the developer tool industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your role is to level us up. You will help take the talented team we have and model and expand our modern best practices. You bring experience with some of our standards and tools, you can quickly learn the rest, and you suggest new ones when helpful. You collaborate to deliver incremental solutions that are both grounded in present needs and filled with optionality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that Snyk’s DevOps approach to security is a best practice. With you, we can make it ubiquitous, by making our platform easy to extend into tools and workflows everywhere. Join us!</span></p>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps, and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS, and others). We also raised an additional $150 Million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21st, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
