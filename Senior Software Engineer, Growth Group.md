<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for impact driven, experienced software engineers to join our Growth group and drive the impact Snyk is making on developers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams in the Growth group focus on acquisition, engagement and conversion of Snyk's individual users. In our work, we focus on business impact:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we analyse the interaction of our users with our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we understand what our users perceive as value in these interactions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we come up with hypotheses on what can increase the value our users gain from our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we experiment iteratively and rapidly to prove or disprove our hypotheses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we implement the proven hypotheses as part of our service</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We build on top of the entire Snyk product offering - Snyk Open Source, Snyk Container, Snyk IaC and Snyk Code. We build on top of the Platform that powers these product offerings. We focus on user behaviour and business metrics that drive the most important needles for the company.</span></p>
<p><strong>This year the teams in the Growth group will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extend our reach to the individual developer, exponentially growing new user registrations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase the engagement of our users, making sure more and more registered users get value out of Snyk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce user churn, helping users make value over longer periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drive conversion, helping business users emerge from our free tier and onboard to Snyk as a customer company</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a versatile, experienced software engineer. You pick the right tool for the job, starting from the end result you want to achieve. Your motivation lies more with your *business* rather than *technical* impact. You thrive on multi-disciplinary teams, working alongside marketers, designers and data analysts.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identifying user behaviour through analytics in a rigorous and trustworthy way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coming up with hypotheses on how user behaviour can change with our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing changes across our entire product surface</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measuring the impact of these changes to prove or disprove these hypotheses</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consider yourself a versatile, self-sufficient full-stack developer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel more comfortable with data you can trust</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel less comfortable with hunches (especially those of other people)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer to disprove a theory quickly rather than exhaust all ways trying to prove it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are comfortable with Git, GitHub and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment workflows</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are proactive, and enjoy working on cross-functional Growth oriented teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are interested in security, developer tooling, and open source</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have Web application (JavaScript / TypeScript) OR IDE plugins (JavaScript / TypeScript / Java) experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience with one or more front-end frameworks e.g React, Vue, Angular</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience working with large data sets and/or with BigQuery</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! Snyk reaches more than 2.2 million developers across the globe, positioned within organizations such as Salesforce, Google, and JP Morgan. Our most recent March 2021 Series E funding round valued us at over $4.6 Billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
