<p><strong>The Security R&amp;D Group</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group is responsible for gathering and curating vulnerabilities from a variety of sources in automatic and semi-automatic processes in order to power a top tier open source vulnerability database. We start by sourcing data from both structured and unstructured public datasets of vulnerabilities. Once sourced, we verify and enhance the data for accuracy (package metadata coordinates, version ranges, etc.) and depth (exported functions leading to vulnerable code execution, etc.). Lastly, we publish the vulnerability data for general use in our Threat Intel feed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another role the group takes is furthering the security strength across the open source ecosystems by identifying not yet disclosed vulnerabilities. We have developed several machine learning algorithms to help uncover what we like to call “half-day” vulnerabilities. These are vulnerabilities that are possibly discussed in various public forums but, remain as of yet, undisclosed officially. We also run a vulnerability disclosure program for community and academic disclosures of vulnerabilities as well as conduct our own proprietary research into vulnerability trends to find and disclose new vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities disclosed, uncovered or discovered by Snyk are discussed and responsibly disclosed to maintainers, and Snyk as CVE Central Naming Authority also issues CVEs and discloses the vulnerabilities to the public at large.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information on this can be found in our recent blog post: </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/why-snyk-wins-open-source-security-battle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/blog/why-snyk-wins-open-source-security-battle/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of the group on the company is measured by several aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">curating the best Vulnerability Database as a core competitive advantage for Snyk, directly impacting our ability to win customer deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spearheading the research and ML capabilities at Snyk to enhance the curation process</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing a production grade service that delivers the Vulnerability Database to the rest of the Snyk product offering, BizDev partners and large customer enterprises.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Senior R&amp;D Director role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an experienced R&amp;D Director to join and lead our Security R&amp;D group.  The group is a home for 15 people, working on Research, Engineering and Threat Intelligence aspects.

The Engineering aspect comes to life with internal and external facing tools and services supporting the research and analysis efforts, serving top tier customers consuming our Threat Intel feed, as well as serving the security data for the snyk products. The Threat Intelligence stream consists of analysis work that furnishes the vulnerability data, making it timely, accurate and usable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an experienced R&amp;D manager, you know how to combine different technical disciplines under a single vision to best serve the company’s business goals.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduce research, analysis and engineering methodologies that promote the group’s success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage the personal growth and success of the individuals in your group</span></li>

We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives.

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we have teams across multiple offices, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripe, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
