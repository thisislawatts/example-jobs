<h4><strong>Role: Sales Director (Account Executive), Commercial</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Location: Boston</strong></h4>
<h4>We’re looking for a collaborative, hard-working Sales Director to join one of the hottest startups in the US!</h4>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></span></h4>
<p>As part of the US sales team within a global sales org you will play a meaningful role in scaling one of the fastest growing companies in the Developer and Security spaces. As a Sales Director at Snyk, you'll be responsible for the end-to-end sales cycle for prospective customers, taking warm inbound leads, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders in the DevSecOps space and digital transformation teams at companies. Our existing customer base ranges from mid-market companies who like to move fast right up to slow burn large enterprises like Google and Salesforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to contribute to the iterative improvement of our sales process, tone and approach, and you'll have plenty of scope to inform the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're a collaborative team from a variety of backgrounds, made up of sales executives and technical sales engineers. We spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team to maximise performance and earning potential.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li>have experience selling a technical product, and you want to join a startup on its way to success.&nbsp;</li>
<li>understand the software developer lifecycle and can articulate how a developer tooling product might fit in.&nbsp;</li>
<li>have experience of both short and long sales cycles.&nbsp;</li>
<li>are self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced environments.&nbsp;</li>
<li>are collaborative and love belonging to a high-achieving sales team.&nbsp;</li>
<li>are resilient: you believe mistakes and failures are learning opportunities, and you value feedback.&nbsp;</li>
<li>are open, honest and take an entrepreneurial approach to sales, mindful of your customer's risk tolerance.&nbsp;</li>
<li>have experience working in a fully remote position.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We are distributed across four offices in Boston, London, Tel Aviv and Ottawa, with 15% of the company working fully-remote. We've made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others' perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what's happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interested?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Please apply below! We care deeply about the warm, inclusive environment we've created and we value diversity - we welcome applications from those typically underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role, but are not totally sure whether you're the right person, do apply anyway :)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p>Snyk's mission is to help companies develop fast and stay secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital transformation has driven companies in all industries to develop faster and adopt modern DevOps processes, modern cloud-native application structure, and an increased dependency on the software supply chain. Traditional application security tools have not been able to keep up. (<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofsecurity/" target="_blank">https://snyk.io/stateofsecurity/</a>). Snyk's unique developer-first approach to cloud native application security enables developers and enterprise security teams to build software securely throughout the software development lifecycle. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, and always focus on our customers and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of 2019, Snyk had adopted more than 450,000 developers, over 500 customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS, Intuit and others). We've also raised an additional $150 million, announced in January 2020, to enable us to execute on our mission.&nbsp;</p>
