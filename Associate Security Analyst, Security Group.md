<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a curious, analytical and detail-oriented Security Analyst to join our team and help us uncover unknown vulnerabilities that exist in open source.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your Role:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, much of any project's code relies on open source packages. These are out there in the world, visible for anyone, and within that code there are vulnerabilities. As part of our security team, you'll join us on our mission to continually improve our ability to find these open source vulnerabilities in a programmatic way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll join our interdisciplinary security team, alongside fully dedicated engineers focussed on building tools that make your work more effective and have lots of opportunities to learn and grow. This role is particularly well-suited to help you develop a deep understanding of how code works, and over time you'll have the opportunity to work with just about every programming language.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further researching known vulnerabilities to determine characteristics such as severity and exploitability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using research to verify or disqualify potential vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using data analyst techniques to answer research questions about vulnerabilities, and general threat intelligence trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing and testing theories and hypotheses around new areas that Snyk tackles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop our product to further achieve our mission</span></li>
</ul>
