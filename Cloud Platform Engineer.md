<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an experienced Cloud Platforms engineer to join our new group and help us build </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/developer-first-sast-with-snyk-code/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our developer-first SAST solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new product enables developers to scan their own source code for security issues and provides meaningful and actionable results to fix those issues. We would like to build this awesome product gradually while keeping on Snyk’s main values: developer-first and security intelligence.</span><strong> You have a great opportunity to join us building this product almost from scratch while creating an innovative environment that evolves rapidly.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has a strong devops culture: the people that build the software, run the software. Our group, Snyk Code, which started few months ago, has drastically increased our system observability, resolved a number of reliability issues at a system pinch points using custom autoscaling, increased quality-of-service guarantees without increasing costs through better capacity planning and intelligent resource allocation, and overhauled our CI/CD tooling. We’re now looking for someone to take us to the next level!</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying software engineering approaches to classic operations problems.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the reliability of Snyk Code’s platform and product via open source observability tools such as Grafana, Prometheus and Jaeger.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting, scaling, upgrading and migrating Kubernetes clusters.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing Infrastructure-as-code in order to support multiple cloud providers and deployment options.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being on call with the Snyk Code development team. Supporting the developers and creating the needed tools and infrastructure to maintain scalability and reliability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building, maintaining and continually improving the tools that we use to deploy and operate the software that we build. This includes automated build and deployment, secrets management, system observability, monitoring, log aggregation, scaling, and more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interacting with technical staff on our on-premise offering to troubleshoot customer issues, and using that experience to mature and improve our on-premises deployment tooling.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across 3 offices in London, Tel Aviv and Zurich, with a major part of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel (when possible…).</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe that devops is an outcome, not a role.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are able to lead full changes and improvements end-2-end.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have hands-on experience as a site reliability engineer or similar.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience building and maintaining devops automation and tooling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate proactively, and enjoy working with people from multiple disciplines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have seen good (and bad) infrastructure, and have opinions about what works and what doesn’t</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are curious and love to explore new domains, technologies, and approaches.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are agile and enjoy the speed of a fast-paced, highly engaged startup environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience running software on Kubernetes (or similar).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience making data-driven infrastructure decisions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like to automate things as much as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have some programming experience.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p>We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</p>
<p>We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</p>
<p>In March of 2021, we&nbsp;<a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a>&nbsp;in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</p>
