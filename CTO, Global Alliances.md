<p><strong>Location: AMER (remote)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s Business Development team’s mission is to find and leverage non-linear growth opportunities across sales, user acquisition, brand recognition and our ecosystem presence. To achieve these goals, Snyk heavily invests in partnerships and alliances, with a deep and substantive product integration vision, and emphasis on a joint GTM approach with our partner ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a Global Alliances CTO to lead and continue to build a forward facing technology vision within our partnership ecosystem. In this role, you will be responsible for all our partnerships, globally, spanning multiple verticals like Security (Rapid7, Trend Micro), Dev Tooling (Atlassian, Docker, CircleCI), APM (Datadog, Dynatrace, AppDynamics), Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM/Red Hat) and GSIs (Accenture, Deloitte, Wipro).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global Alliances CTO reports to and works closely with the VP of Business and Corporate Development to combine Snyk’s business strategy and execution with our technical vision.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the perfect role for business savvy “big picture” technologists, who understand the DevOps, Security and Dev Tooling spaces, can build a forward facing technology vision for how Snyk can win by partnering, get all the internal and external stakeholders on board, and then execute on the partnership vision. As an example, can take inspiration from some of Snyk’s most celebrated partnerships, like with Docker and with Atlassian, in which Snyk partnered with other best-of-breed companies in the developer tool chain to bring security natively in those tools… where developers are at.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Managing the Partner Solutions Architects: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll lead&nbsp; a team of highly technical partner solutions architects working within our various partner verticals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Driving Internal Enablement:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Creating the partnership is just the beginning, you’ll be responsible for the strategy &amp; messaging so Snyk’s field teams understand, and take advantage of the various partnerships and integrations Snyk has put in place</span></li>
