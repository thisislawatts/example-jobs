<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an experienced and compassionate architect to join th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e Snyk Products Division. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">human side of development is very important to this role; you’ll need to be collaborative, empathetic and used to leading without authority. Architects at Snyk do not dictate design but rather help teams build a solution that the team is comfortable owning and operating. You’ll be supporting teams with advice on best practices and helping them design for the future of Snyk, while giving them the space and confidence to learn and experiment with new approaches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little about us! We are responsible for Application code analysis across all of Snyk's supported languages, providing data on security issues. We primarily use TypeScript as well as some Go, and manage our services with Helm, ArgoCD and Kubernetes. We deploy constantly throughout the day with various CI services such as CircleCI or GitHub Actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love delivering fast and iteratively, always questioning what we can do better. We have regular knowledge sharing sessions, with members of the group presenting on all sorts of topics; anything from hour-long discussions on consensus protocols to 30 seconds on why TypeScript enums are rubbish. Overall, we want to have a group of smart, motivated people who feel they can learn, grow and have a laugh.</span></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are you?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a versatile, experienced architect with a strong engineering background. You pick the right tool for the job, starting from the end result you want to achieve.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d like to hear from you if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are excited about building a technical vision for a software product group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience with cloud infrastructure (Kubernetes, GCP, AWS)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrive on growing systems to scale</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy collaborating with a wide range of peers and mentoring engineers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like to start new things, see them through to production, and learn from your mistakes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move quickly, iteratively, and proactively and believe that shipping early is best</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are a team player who enjoys learning and sharing with your peers and are comfortable pair programming</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know one of our programming languages well (TypeScript, Golang, Java) - the more, the better!</span></li>
