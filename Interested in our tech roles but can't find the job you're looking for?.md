<h3><strong>Can’t find the job you’re looking for? </strong></h3>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source software is a force for good, and as the use of it continues to grow, security becomes </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise teams who aren’t security experts to stay secure. Offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps, and DevSecOps workflows, Snyk is leading the industry in timeliness to find and publish, and fix open source vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After going through 3 rounds of funding, Snyk went through its Series C round in January 2020 where we raised an additional </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$150 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to further grow our developer-first approach to security. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Working at Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our product and engineering teams are distributed between the UK and Israel, with the majority of Snykers working in London and Tel Aviv. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company, and with our team-first mindset, we understand the importance of proactive communication and enabling tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, our teams are structured to be cross-disciplinary; for instance, our product managers work alongside our engineers as we develop new features. In their day to day work, teams follow the Agile software development methodology and work at a sustainable pace in two-week sprints.  As we care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop for all of our customers and users, we maintain our product minded focus through prioritizing testing, code quality, and code review.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Our current tech stack includes but is not limited to:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NodeJS, JavaScript, Vue.js, TypeScript, jQuery, Express, Postgresql, SQL, SaaS, BEM, CSS, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Docker, Kubernetes, Fractal, Kibana, and Elasticsearch.</span></p>
