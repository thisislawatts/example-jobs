</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be a part of the Product Marketing team and will work closely with product management, sales, marketing, and developer relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company typically working fully remote.
