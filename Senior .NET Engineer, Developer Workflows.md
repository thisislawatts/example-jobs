<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we believe that the open source world and the community around it is a force for good. We’ve brought together a team of security experts and talented software developers to make it easier for everyone to use open source safely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 2.2M developers already depend on our enterprise-grade solution to find and fix their vulnerable dependencies. We protect more than 100,000 open source projects, and we have many large organisations on board, including Google, New Relic and ASOS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We receive regular contributions (and love!) from the community, we have some </span><a href="https://snyk.io/partners"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fantastic partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amplifying our reach, and around 1,500 badges in GitHub championing us, including top projects like </span><a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreeCodeCamp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/request/request/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently </span><a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $300M</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from investors such as Accel and Tiger Global, bringing our company valuation to 4.7 billion, and demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about the warm, inclusive working environment we've fostered, where we can benefit from the different perspectives within our team. We are collaborative, curious, and respectful - it’s important to us that everyone feels comfortable contributing their ideas and views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are around 500+ people (and counting!), distributed across offices in London, Tel Aviv, Ottawa, and Boston, with several people working fully-remote. We’ve made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel</span></p>
