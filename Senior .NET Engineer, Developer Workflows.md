<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel more comfortable with data you can trust, and less comfortable with hunches (especially those of other people)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer to disprove a theory quickly rather than exhaust all ways trying to prove it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are comfortable with Git, GitHub and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment workflows</span></li>
