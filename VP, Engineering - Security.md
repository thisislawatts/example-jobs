<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is used by millions of developers, driven by its successful freemium motion (unique in the security industry) and its focus on putting the developer first. We secure the code you write with Snyk Code, the libraries you depend upon with Snyk Open Source, the containers you package it all into with Snyk Container and the infrastructure that you run it on with Snyk Infrastructure as Code. This analysis relies on deep application &amp; security intelligence - knowing the right security questions to ask, and thoroughly understanding the application to be able to answer them. Our leading vulnerability database and our machine-learning based program analysis are key for delivering on our promise of securing software, and a huge factor in our commercial success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an experienced and highly motivated Engineering leader for our Security division, owning security intelligence across all Snyk products. The Security division ensures our users get the most comprehensive, timely, detailed and actionable vulnerability and risk data within the full application context. As a successful and impactful VP of Engineering for Security, you would lead the division in building the world’s leading application security products.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will report to our SVP of Engineering, as part of the Engineering team, which partners with our Product team to build and continuously improve our products. Together, you will deliver the company’s security and risk vision, driving Snyk users to find, prioritize, triage and fix the vulnerabilities that matter most within their unique application context. The Security division currently has 3 groups of teams: Security R&amp;D (collecting and cultivating security data, Triage &amp; Prioritisation, and Security Research), Insights (a full 360 degree view of application security posture), and AI (analyzing and modeling complex applications and attacker risk paths with speed and accuracy).&nbsp; The engineering directors level leaders of all 3 groups will report into this position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We embody the company values: We Ship It, work as One Team, Care Deeply, Think Bigger and Learn Always.&nbsp;</span></p>
