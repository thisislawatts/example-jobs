</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 15% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have at least 3 years or equivalent experience in full lifecycle technical recruiting and sourcing</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are great at building relationships with stakeholders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">love to source, but also enjoy managing relationships with direct or agency applicants</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enjoy working in a fast paced, high growth company and feel comfortable with ambiguity </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">value diversity and believe strongly in creating inclusive environment</span></li>
