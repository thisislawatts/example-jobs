<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is used by millions of developers, driven by its successful freemium motion - unique in the security industry - and its focus on putting the developer first. We secure the code you write, with Snyk Code, the libraries you depend upon with Snyk Open Source, the containers you package it all into with Snyk Container and the infrastructure that you run it on with Snyk Infrastructure as Code. Our product-led growth approach is critical to Snyk’s business success with our disruptive developer security platform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>We're looking for an experienced Product growth leader to drive impact in key areas of acquisition, engagement and retention, and monetisation.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has been a developer-focused company from day one, gaining most of its commercial interest bottom-up and directly from developers.
