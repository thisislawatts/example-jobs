<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Account Executive, Enterprise Expansion Sales</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Coast, Remote | Sales</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/cloud-native-application-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer security platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enables modern applications to be built securely, empowering developers to own and build security for the whole application, from code &amp; open source to containers &amp; cloud infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As an Expansion Rep for Snyk’s Enterprise team, you’ll work closely with our Named Account Executives, Customer Success, Sales engineering, and BDR&nbsp; teams to identify new opportunities to expand Snyk usage within our existing clients.&nbsp; We want you to contribute to the iterative improvement of our sales process, tone and approach, and you’ll have plenty of scope to inform the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We’re a collaborative team from a variety of backgrounds, made up of sales executives and technical sales engineers.&nbsp; We spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Building strong relationships with our existing client base</li>
<li>Mapping out how these organizations work: identifying how departments and teams interact, the internal processes for getting things done, and understanding how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within the org.</li>
<li>Becoming a product expert for the new features and products our engineering teams release, and introducing these to existing clients</li>
<li>Collaborating closely with our core Sales Reps and our Customer Success team to identify new upselling opportunities with existing clients</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company we are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have enterprise sales experience managing multiple Global 2000 accounts and maintaining strong, positive C level relationships with existing clients</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have 5+ years of successful closing experience selling Cloud, SaaS and/or Cybersecurity technologies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a track record of identifying and executing on upsell opportunities in existing deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have proven success in navigating mid to large enterprise clients, managing competing political priorities, and doing large (ELA type transactions)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re organized, rigorous, and love to improve processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are excited about what Snyk is doing and want to join this rocketship on its way to success</span></li>
