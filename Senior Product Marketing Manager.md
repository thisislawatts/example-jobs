A key part of your role will be to become the Snyk expert on the open source package security market, on customer pain points and requirements and their buyer journey, and the growing competitive landscape.&nbsp; You will use that knowledge to build the messaging for the product and to develop content, sales tools and stories that communicate the product’s value across all channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll be responsible for:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing collateral and training materials to enable our fast-growing sales team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaging with customers and sharing insights back to the product, marketing and sales teams.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be a part of the Product Marketing team and will work closely with product management, sales, marketing, and developer relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company typically working fully remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have demonstrated success as a member or leader of a product marketing team for a B2B company with experience creating messaging for security and developer personas.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have first-hand experience working with or marketing developer tools, or security solutions pertaining to development, or automation features like APIs.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a technical curiosity and aptitude but are a marketer at heart with passion and talent for content creation, marketing and communications.</span></li>
