<p><strong><em>The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for experienced, enthusiastic and collaborative engineers to help us on our journey of bringing the power of Snyk to every developerâ€™s fingertips. As a senior engineer&nbsp; you'll be a key contributor in building tools and services that enable developers to integrate Snyk into their workflows, such as IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, Source Control Management (SCM) platforms like GitHub and productivity applications such as the Atlassian ecosystem. Youâ€™ll help solve big challenges like architecting our new micro services, building performant and resilient distributed systems at scale, and delivering functionality to millions of developers where they work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong><em>Who are we?</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Workflows group focuses on providing frictionless integrations that allow developers to seamlessly consume security insights and remediate issues within the tools and workflows that they care about.&nbsp; We build services that enable, and tools that leverage, the entire Snyk product offering â€“ </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk Open Source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk Container</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk IaC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We focus on user behavior and business metrics that drive the most important needles for the company. If you've used Snykâ€™s IDE plugin, have your GitHub code tested in the Snyk web app, or use `</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">snyk monitor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">` in your CI pipeline - that's us!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a distributed team, and many of us work from home or in our offices. Our colleagues are based in the UK, Israel, Germany, Switzerland, and Romania.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a senior engineer youâ€™ll spend your time coding and pair programming across the stack mostly with TypeScript, and you may also come across Golang and Java codebases. <br>We value the craftsmanship side of engineering and youâ€™ll be empowered to shape the technology owned by the team while maintaining and supporting a reliable, fast service for customers, at scale. And just as importantly, youâ€™ll play a key role in growing great engineers around you through mentorship and leading by example. <br><br>We'd like to meet you if you are a versatile engineer experienced in TypeScript or Golang, who understands the importance of code quality and automated testing (experience in TDD is a plus). You care deeply about the user experience and proactively suggest UX improvements based on data you can trust. You thrive on multi-disciplinary teams working alongside product managers and designers, move quickly, iteratively, and proactively and feel comfortable working on cloud-native application development.</span></p>
