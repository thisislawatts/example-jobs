<p><strong><em>The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for experienced, enthusiastic and collaborative engineers to help us on our journey of bringing the power of Snyk to every developer‚Äôs fingertips. As a senior engineer&nbsp; you'll be a key contributor in building tools and services that enable developers to integrate Snyk into their workflows, such as IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, Source Control Management (SCM) platforms like GitHub and productivity applications such as the Atlassian ecosystem. You‚Äôll help solve big challenges like architecting our new micro services, building performant and resilient distributed systems at scale, and delivering functionality to millions of developers where they work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong><em>Who are we?</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Workflows group focuses on providing frictionless integrations that allow developers to seamlessly consume security insights and remediate issues within the tools and workflows that they care about.&nbsp; We build services that enable, and tools that leverage, the entire Snyk product offering ‚Äì </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk Open Source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk Container</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk IaC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We focus on user behavior and business metrics that drive the most important needles for the company. If you've used Snyk‚Äôs IDE plugin, have your GitHub code tested in the Snyk web app, or use `</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">snyk monitor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">` in your CI pipeline - that's us!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a distributed team, and many of us work from home or in our offices. Our colleagues are based in the UK, Israel, Germany, Switzerland, and Romania.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a senior engineer you‚Äôll spend your time coding and pair programming across the stack mostly with TypeScript, and you may also come across Golang and Java codebases. <br>We value the craftsmanship side of engineering and you‚Äôll be empowered to shape the technology owned by the team while maintaining and supporting a reliable, fast service for customers, at scale. And just as importantly, you‚Äôll play a key role in growing great engineers around you through mentorship and leading by example. <br><br>We'd like to meet you if you are a versatile engineer experienced in TypeScript or Golang, who understands the importance of code quality and automated testing (experience in TDD is a plus). You care deeply about the user experience and proactively suggest UX improvements based on data you can trust. You thrive on multi-disciplinary teams working alongside product managers and designers, move quickly, iteratively, and proactively and feel comfortable working on cloud-native application development.</span></p>
