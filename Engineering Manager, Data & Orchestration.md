<p class="p3">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span class="s3">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a>). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows.

We also raised an additional $150 Million, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span class="s3">announced January 21st, 2020</span></a>, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</p>
<p class="p3">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</p>
