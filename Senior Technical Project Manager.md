<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a project management leader that will define/create much of our approach to IT project planning, management and delivery. You are not stepping into a clean, well-defined role. You are the “prototype” for the IT project management function at Snyk; the one who will help us figure out how to plan, execute and communicate this work to all of Snyk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will not be managing one large, “waterfall” enterprise software project at a time. Instead, you will juggle 10-15 projects at a go. Some might only last a week, others a month or two. You will help us get better at planning and executing these projects. You will also put in place the measurements and data to help us better understand and communicate our capacity and commitments.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering closely with Snyk business stakeholders to ensure we are accurately translating internal needs into well defined projects and backlogs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guiding our Tech Operations and Systems Engineering teams (our IT delivery teams) in the prioritisation and implementation of solutions that are aligned with the needs and prioritisation of the company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking and reporting on projects and their associated KPIs, such as the roll out of a new HRIS system (Workday), or the implementation of a company-wide internal support system and process</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiring a Product Thinking mindset across the entire CIS group, as a well as introducing agility and transparency to our IT development processes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating project templates for reliable, repeatable execution of projects.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have proven experience in being a technical project manager</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience managing an ongoing portfolio of varied projects. This is not a job for people with only serial project management experience.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are able to adapt in a fast-paced environment, with the ability to manage competing priorities and multi-task</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate proactively, and enjoy working with people from multiple disciplines across engineering, marketing, sales, security, HR and finance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adept at working across multiple teams, with the ability to set a vision and roadmap at a group level</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps, and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2020 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 600,000 developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS, and others). We also raised an additional $150 Million,</span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21st, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure</span></p>
