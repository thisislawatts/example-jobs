<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team collaborates with all of Snyk’s departments to support the evaluation, implementation and operation of technologies across all departments, as well as the rollout of systems and integrations to support our fast growing company in its adoption of new systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current technology environment includes a handful of core systems like Salesforce, Marketo, Netsuite, Slack, Google Workspace, Okta and Workday along with a lot of other SaaS apps. This environment is rapidly changing. We are adding applications, workflows and integrations all the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a project manager that will define and create much of our approach to IT project planning, management and delivery. You are not stepping into a clean, well-defined role. You are the “prototype” for the tech project management function at Snyk; the one who will help us figure out how to plan, execute and communicate this work to all of Snyk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will juggle multiple projects at any given time. Some might only last a month, others several months to a year. You will help us get better at planning and executing these projects. You will also put in place the measurements and data to help us better understand and communicate our capacity and commitments. This role will report to the Senior Manager of Technical Programs.&nbsp;</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiring a Product Thinking mindset across the entire CIS group, as a well as introducing agility and transparency to our IT development processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating project templates for reliable, repeatable execution of projects</span></li>
</ul>
