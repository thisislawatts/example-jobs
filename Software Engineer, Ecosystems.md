<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p>Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.</p>
<p>The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (<a class="c-link" href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/" target="_blank" data-stringify-link="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</a>).

We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By September 2020, Snyk was already adopted by over 1.5M developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others).</p>
<p>Our September 2020 Series D funding round of $200M has put us at over $2.6 billion company valuation.We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</p>
