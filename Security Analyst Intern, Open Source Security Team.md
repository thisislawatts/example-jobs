<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, much of any project's code relies on open source packages.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using research to verify or disqualify potential vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop our product to further&nbsp; our mission</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicating with maintainers of open source libraries</span></li>
