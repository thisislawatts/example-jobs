<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We're looking for a Senior Product Manager, focussing on supporting the scale and extensibility of Snyk’s platform to support multiple products, which are used by hundreds of thousands of developers, who collaborate on millions of projects, whilst staying ridiculously easy to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Platform Core</strong> group focuses on capabilities that are shared between all Snyk’s products, including policies, reporting, user management and projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Senior Product Manager for Snyk, you’ll collaborate with a distributed engineering team focused on the same goal: building and enhancing the common areas of our product that cater to all our users across all our products. You’ll work with your team to scale and standardize parts of the platform used by our customers and integrations (such as our API and webhooks), so they’re extensible and easy to use, helping broaden the impact that Snyk can have.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also talk with customers, prospects and internal stakeholders to gather feedback and iterate on solutions. As well as this, you’ll help evolve the practices and architecture relied on by other product teams, allowing them to move fast, securely, at scale.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working hands-on with engineers, engineering managers and designers as part of a cross-functional product team, guiding product development and producing clear product requirements&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining metrics and analysing data on usage and business performance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysing Snyk’s competitive landscape to ensure a leading product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking with our customers, and potential customers, to understand their needs, gather feedback and requirements, and collaborate with them to build and validate solutions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining and then communicating the product roadmap, both inside Snyk and with customers and prospects</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting and guiding other product managers to help refine plans across Snyk’s product range</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Informing and improving our product processes, and the way all product managers work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring delivered features reach the desired business outcomes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our teams are generally distributed between multiple offices and timezones, so we use Slack and Zoom to keep in contact with one another, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">travelling around once a quarter (in normal times!) to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gather feedback from our users and spend time working face-to-face with the engineers that aren’t colocated with you.</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have product management experience in some or all of B2B SaaS, developer tooling or extensible platform services such as APIs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a strong technical background</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have excellent written and verbal communication skills in English, and enjoy helping others to learn new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy working in, and leading, cross-functional delivery teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like to start new things, see them through to production, and learn from your mistakes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are comfortable adjusting priorities at short notice to respond to changes in the market</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are happy to travel at least once a quarter (under usual circumstances) to gather feedback from our users and to spend time working face-to-face with other colleagues that aren’t colocated with you</span></li>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we raised $300M in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure. Join us!</span></p>
