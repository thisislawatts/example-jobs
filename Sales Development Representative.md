<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an enterprising, ambitious Sales Development Representative to join our team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of our fast-growing sales team, you’ll have insight into how the full sales-cycle works, exposure to high profile customers, a strong technical grounding in our product, and lots of mentorship and training.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account mapping and researching potential accounts that fit our Ideal Customer Profile</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sourcing qualified contacts using our persona guidelines</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage tools to prioritise account out-reach</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enroll accounts/contacts in customised sequences</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set meetings and generate pipeline for the sales team </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about learning and development, and will support you as you grow. You’ll have opportunities to learn from experienced Account Executives, including participating in initial demonstrations, and gaining a deep understanding of how multiple selling motions work in a  high-growth technology company focussed on security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are ambitious, organised and energetic</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You build strong, meaningful relationships and take pride in being a great communicator</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re driven: you strive to exceed your goals, and love the challenge of working in a fast-paced environment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are collaborative and want to work in a diverse, high-performing team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are resilient and continually working to be better</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re open, honest and love to learn</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re excited about technology and security, and you want to join a high-growth startup</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/">announced January 21, 2020</a>. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripe, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
