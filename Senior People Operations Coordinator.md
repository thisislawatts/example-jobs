<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also raised an additional $200 Million, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-200m-to-modernize-security-industry/" target="_blank">announced on September 9, 2020</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure</span></p>
