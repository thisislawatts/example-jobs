<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer, Platform Group</strong></p>
<p><strong>UK, Israel, Switzerland or North America (EST, AST or NST only)</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>We have offices in London, Tel Aviv, Zurich, Boston and Ottawa if you prefer not to work remotely.</strong></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a number of smart, caring and proactive senior software engineers to join our core product teams to help our enterprise customers adopt open source and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams in the Platform Group aim to build a scalable, extensible platform that is used by both our Snyk product offering teams and our Enterprise customers to solve complex challenges, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onboarding large developer teams onto our multi-tenant SaaS offering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing and reporting on all the data generated within the enterprise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying policies that ease security compliance as an integral part of the software development lifecycle process</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the teams will extend our ability to onboard customers 100x times larger than we have now; redesign and replatform our reporting offering from the ground up and build a flexible and extensible role-based authorization system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Snyk, you’ll use your knowledge and passion as a developer, along with your problem solving skills to help us develop software that, in turn, helps others to develop software that is and remains secure.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning everything from the commercial success to operational insight of specific features in our product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaging in problem analysis and collaborating with product to create plans that continue to delight our current users and win new ones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executing on those plans by coding across the full stack</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace, in two-week sprints&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promoting technical excellence across the team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentoring and coaching other engineers in the team &amp; group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking part in our on-call rotation to maintain and support our production service (for a week every ~10 weeks)</span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we <a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a> in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
