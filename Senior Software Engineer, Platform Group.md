<h3><em><strong><sub>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.</sub></strong></em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a supportive, proactive senior software engineer to join one of our core product teams to help our enterprise customers adopt open source and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams on the Enterprise Group aim to solve challenges encountered by the CISO of a large enterprise, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onboarding large developer teams onto our multi-tenant SaaS offering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing and reporting on a large count of applications developed within the enterprise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying policies that ease security compliance as an integral part of the software development lifecycle process</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaging in problem analysis and collaborating with the product team to create feature plans that outline implementation details</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coding and building features on ad-hoc, cross-functional feature teams&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace, in two-week sprints&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promoting technical practice improvements across the team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supporting and mentoring more junior team members</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking part in maintaining and supporting our service during our on-call rotation (for a week every 10 weeks)</span></li>

By September 2020, Snyk was already adopted by over 1.5M developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others).</p>
<p>Our September 2020 Series D funding round of $200M has put us at over $2.6 billion company valuation.We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</p>
