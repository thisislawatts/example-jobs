<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer, Platform Group</strong></p>
<p><strong>UK, Israel, Switzerland or North America (EST, AST or NST only)</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>We have offices in London, Tel Aviv, Zurich, Boston and Ottawa if you prefer not to work remotely.</strong></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a number of smart, caring and proactive senior software engineers to join our core product teams to help our enterprise customers adopt open source and stay secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams in the Platform Group aim to build a scalable, extensible platform that is used by both our Snyk product offering teams and our Enterprise customers to solve complex challenges, namely:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onboarding large developer teams onto our multi-tenant SaaS offering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing and reporting on all the data generated within the enterprise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying policies that ease security compliance as an integral part of the software development lifecycle process</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the teams will extend our ability to onboard customers 100x times larger than we have now; redesign and replatform our reporting offering from the ground up and build a flexible and extensible role-based authorization system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Snyk, you’ll use your knowledge and passion as a developer, along with your problem solving skills to help us develop software that, in turn, helps others to develop software that is and remains secure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning everything from the commercial success to operational insight of specific features in our product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaging in problem analysis and collaborating with product to create plans that continue to delight our current users and win new ones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executing on those plans by coding across the full stack</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace, in two-week sprints&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promoting technical excellence across the team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentoring and coaching other engineers in the team &amp; group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking part in our on-call rotation to maintain and support our production service (for a week every ~10 weeks)</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we believe that the open source world and the community around it is a force for good. We’ve brought together a team of security experts and talented software developers to make it easier for everyone to use open source safely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are around 500+ people (and counting!), distributed across offices in London, Tel Aviv, Ottawa, and Boston, with several people working fully-remote. We’ve made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office trave</span></p>
