<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a proactive, super-organised, newly qualified Financial Controller to take charge of our accounting and assist our Group Financial Controller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The finance team is responsible for gathering and providing accurate financial information to the management team and board members to help the business stay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data-driven and strategy focused. This year the team has expanded massively, from a team of three to a team of thirteen, as the department has been broken down into three functions (Accounting, Billing and Financial Planning) in order to cope with company growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this role you’ll work closely with our Group Financial Controller, gain insight into how the finance function works in a high-growth multi-subsidiary global SaaS business, and have the opportunity to develop your finance skills. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Your role:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll take full responsibility for reviewing our invoice set up process, issuing payments and related operational finance tasks. Wherever we can, we try to automate repetitive processes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and use tools that enable us to maximise the value we create with the work we do.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing the month-ends reporting and owning the management account pack</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviewing and processing payment runs, and ensuring they are approved promptly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working across multiple processes to ensure a series of tight deadlines are met</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviewing and processing payroll and expenses reports for the whole team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping the Management Accountant review the accounts payable and accounts receivable transactions</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving the processes that we use so that they’re frictionless, effective, and precise</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).

By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also raised an additional $70 Million, </span><a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-open-source-security-platform-snyk-raises-70m-1001300189"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced September 10, 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  from investors such as Accel, GV and Boldstart, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
