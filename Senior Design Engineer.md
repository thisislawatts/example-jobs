<div class="content-intro"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, the world gets more digital thanks to tens of millions of developers building the future faster than ever. But with exponential growth comes exponential risk, as outnumbered security teams struggle to secure mountains of code. This is where Snyk (pronounced “sneak”) comes in. Snyk is a developer security platform that makes it easy for development teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and cloud infrastructure — and do it all right from the start. Snyk is on a mission to make the world a more secure place by empowering developers to develop fast and stay secure.</span></p></div><hr>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,00 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, announced January 21, 2020. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.<br></span></p>
