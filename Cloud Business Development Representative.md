<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an enterprising, ambitious Cloud Business Development Representative to join our team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source software is booming: technology is integral to almost every facet of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t security experts</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a developer tooling company with deep security expertise: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organizations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cloud BDR role is an incredible opportunity to join a highly successful team dedicated to embracing and upleveling our strategic cloud alliances. This person will work directly with the Global Director of Strategic Cloud Alliances to grow our co-selling motion with AWS &amp; Microsoft Azure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we focus on joint pipeline generation, deal acceleration, and repeatable recipes for success you will help identify top co-sell target accounts and opportunities to share with our cloud partners. You will gain intimate knowledge of the co-sell process from managing lead share platforms and ongoing opportunity hygiene through closing and registering the wins. You will work with partner teams across cloud organizations enhancing your professional network and creating a foundation for future career development.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Interested?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We'd love to hear from you - please apply below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We value diversity at Snyk, and would particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role, but are not totally sure whether you’re the right person, do apply anyway.</span></p>
