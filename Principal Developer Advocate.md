<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to build security into development - the only way security can scale. To get such dev adoption, we built a dev tooling company, not a cyber company. We’re looking to delight and engage developers as we help them secure what they build. This approach spans the entire company, from product to commercial to community - which is where you come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a passionate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, self-directed Principal Developer Advocate to define strategy, grow the team, rapidly drive adoption and community engagement </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to educate, empower, and enable developers in container security and application security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Relations team collaborates closely with developers to raise awareness around the importance of security in the application lifecycle, educating them through content, engineering, presentations, videos, etc. about application security and pragmatic best practices they can use.</span></p>
<p><strong>As a Principal Developer Advocate at Snyk:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will create, mentor, inspire, and lead driven teams to deliver on a strategy and well-defined plan. You will identify and lead new projects and initiatives and grow the developer-first security approach and Snyk platform adoption. </span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being a thought leader in the developer advocacy group and helping steer the team with project ideas and roadmap planning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying and leading or creating innovative integrations and solutions to help users interact with Snyk in different environments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing awareness around the Snyk platform by educating open-source users and communities about the importance of DevSecOps and Snyk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working closely together with our partners, customers, the development, product and marketing teams, and of course the broader developer communities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being the public face of Snyk at conferences, community meetups and customer events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">producing great security content in a variety of different media : blog posts, videos, podcasts, cheat-sheets, particularly around container and application security</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split between the US and EU. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have previous experience and are a leader in the field of developer advocacy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re passionate about building security into application development and are keen to share these with Developer and DevOps teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are at your best when thinking outside the box, innovating, and inspiring those around you</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have previous experience with containers </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pride yourself on the quality and accessibility of your writing and teaching</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are comfortable preparing and presenting technical talks to keynotes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have strong application security experience, or have worked with security engineers, including security leads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have led or been a key influencer in developer advocacy teams</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, our work is purely virtual given the pandemic. Once made possible, you should expect to spend around a quarter of your time traveling, so you will need to hold a valid passport at all times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please apply below!

<h2><strong>About Snyk</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps, and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston, and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,00 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity, and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
