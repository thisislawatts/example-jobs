<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Expansion Rep for Snyk, you’ll work closely with our Customer Success &amp; Core Sales teams to identify new opportunities to expand Snyk usage within our existing clients.

<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building strong relationships with our existing client base (giving extra attention to those clients who haven’t heard from us in a while)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mapping out how these organizations work: identifying how departments and teams interact, the internal processes for getting things done, and understanding how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within the org.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">becoming a product expert for the new features and products our engineering teams release, and introducing these to existing clients</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a track record of identifying and executing on upsell opportunities in existing deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand people: what makes them tick, what their attitude is to us, when they’re most likely to want to buy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are organized, rigorous, and love to improve processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a startup on its way to success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced, collaborative teams</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. The use of open source is booming, but <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span class="s2">security is a key concern</span></a>. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,00 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span class="s2">announced January 21, 2020</span></a>. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
