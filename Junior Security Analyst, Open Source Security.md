<p><strong>Junior Security Analyst</strong><strong>, Open Source Security Team</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a curious, analytical and detail-oriented Junior Security Analyst to join our team and help us maintain the best open source vulnerability database in the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, much of any project's code relies on open source packages. These are out there in the world, visible for anyone, and within that code there are vulnerabilities. As part of our security team, you'll join us on our mission to continually improve our ability to find these open source vulnerabilities in a programmatic way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll join our interdisciplinary security team, alongside fully dedicated engineers focused on building tools that make your work more effective and have lots of opportunities to learn and grow. This role is particularly well-suited to help you develop a deep understanding of how code works, and over time you'll have the opportunity to work with just about every programming language.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">further researching known vulnerabilities to determine characteristics such as severity and exploitability</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using research to verify or disqualify potential vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop our product to further&nbsp; our mission</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have worked within the security space before either analysing specific vulnerabilities, or looking into wider vulnerability types, threats or trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a general understanding of security issues and vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a passion for security and an interest in the problem space</span></li>
