<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Marketing Manager</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: Boston, Tel Aviv, London, Switzerland or Remote (Time Zone Israel - Eastern US)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We're looking for an energetic, driven, and hands-on Product Marketing Manager to support our rapid growth.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Your role</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll join our multi-talented marketing team and take ownership of our product marketing activities for our new Snyk Infrastructure as Code product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a featured product in Snyk’s cloud native application security platform, Snyk Infrastructure as Code (Snyk IaC) helps developers write secure configurations, well before anything reaches production. Snyk’s developer-first approach meets developers where they work and provides fixes that can be directly merged into code.&nbsp; You will help us convey this value across our audiences, whether to an individual developer, to an application security manager, or to software development leaders, operations managers and security executives at large software-driven enterprises.&nbsp; A key part of your role will be to become the Snyk expert on the IaC security market, on customer pain points and requirements and their buyer journey, and the competitive landscape.&nbsp; You will use that knowledge to build the messaging for the product and to develop content, sales tools and stories that communicate the product’s value across all channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You'll be responsible for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crafting compelling messaging about Snyk IaC’s value in the market and to security and development teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being a key point of communication and alignment across marketing, product and sales teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing our go to market process for new features and releases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing collateral and training materials to enable our fast-growing sales team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engaging with customers and sharing insights back to the product, marketing and sales teams.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be a part of the Product Marketing team and will work closely with product management, sales, marketing, and developer relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company typically working fully-remote, and 100% remote at present due to the pandemic. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>You should apply if:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have demonstrated success as a member or leader of a product marketing team for a B2B company focusing on the security, developer and / or devops ecosystem</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have first-hand experience working with or marketing developer tools and/or security solutions pertaining to IaC. For example, Kubernetes, Terraform or AWS CloudFormation or other similar or emerging tools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a technical curiosity and aptitude but are a marketer at heart with passion and talent for content creation, marketing and communications.</span></li>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation. Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and the demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has been adopted by over 2.2M developers who use Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we raised $300M in Series E funding, bringing our company valuation to&nbsp; $4.7 billion, after recently securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions with DeepCode &amp; Manifold. On top of that, we have doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
