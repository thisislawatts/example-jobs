<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate proactively, and enjoy working with people from multiple disciplines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have worked with cloud compute and storage, including public cloud vendors (AWS, GCP, or Azure).</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are willing to inspect and change the status quo – to discover fresh ideas on how infrastructure is built, delivered, and operated at scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you have:</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2020 alone, Snyk had already over 600,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $200 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-200m-to-modernize-security-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced September, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
