<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a talented, thoughtful software developer to join our security team to work on our ML-enhanced vulnerability pipeline and management tools so that we can surface, verify, and</span><a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publish vulnerabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security team works to develop novel, effective methods to sift through likely vulnerabilities in open source which haven’t yet been discovered, verified, or disclosed. Through pulling them into our data pipeline, the team makes it as simple as possible for our security analysts and researchers to focus on validating them and adding them to our database.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Snyk, you’ll help us expand the reach of our vulnerability pipeline, and contribute to the building of our critical infrastructure that supports our analyst team to verify and publish all the vulnerabilities you find. </span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing algorithms to automatically find previously undisclosed vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing algorithms into our data-intensive pipeline system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">modelling the data in our database and displaying it in our management system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enhancing both systems to help our analyst team work more efficiently</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engineering both systems to scale (this is an ongoing effort, as the scale is constantly increasing)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building the infrastructure needed to support our security researchers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working collaboratively with analysts to tackle issues with vulnerabilities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are interested in machine learning and using Python</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have recreated large scraping frameworks from design to implementation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about iterative improvement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">think really understanding a task is 80% of the success of a project</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appreciate being part of a diverse team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate proactively and speak English to a good standard</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">really enjoy solving problems, and love learning new things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are interested in security or open source software, and you believe in our mission</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). We also raised an additional 70m, </span><a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-open-source-security-platform-snyk-raises-70m-1001300189"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced September 10, 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  from investors such as Accel, GV and Boldstart, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What does our interview process look like?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start by having a video call to get to know you. We’ll tell you more about us, what we’re up to on our different teams, and why our culture is so great! We also want to hear about you, your skills and experience, and why you are interested in exploring Snyk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up we’ll send you a coding exercise. Ideally, you will get it back to us within a week and we can take a look at your work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there we’ll have an onsite interview where you will get to visit our office, meet a few different members of the team, do some pairing and extension work on your coding exercise, and find out everything you need to know about the way we work.</span></p>
