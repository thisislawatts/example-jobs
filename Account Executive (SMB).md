<p><strong>Location: Boston</strong></p>
<p><strong>We're looking for a collaborative, hard-working Sales Director to join one of the hottest startups in the US!</strong></p>
<h3>Your Role</h3>
<p>As part of the US Sales team within a global sales org you will play a meaningful role in scaling one of the fastest growing companies in the Developer Security space. As a Sales Director at Snyk, you'll be responsible for the end-to-end sales cycle for net new small medium business customers. This will include sourcing leads and connecting with prospects in accounts that match our ideal customer profile, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders in the DevSecOps, Development, and Digital Transformation teams at those accounts. Our existing customer base ranges from mid-market companies who like to move fast right up to slow burn large enterprises like Google and Salesforce.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to contribute to the iterative improvement of our sales process, tone and approach, and you'll have plenty of scope to inform the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're a collaborative team from a variety of backgrounds, made up of sales executives and technical sales engineers. We spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experiences we have within the team to maximise performance and earning potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You Should Join Us If:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have experience selling a technical product, and you want to join a startup on its way to success.</li>
<li>You understand the software developer lifecycle and can articulate how a developer tooling product might fit in.</li>
<li>You have experience of both short and long sales cycles.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You're self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced environments.</li>
<li>You are collaborative and love belonging to a high achieving sales team.</li>
<li>You are resilient: you believe mistakes and failures are learning opportunities, and you value feedback.</li>
<li>You're open, honest and take an entrepreneurial approach to sales, mindful of your customer's risk tolerance.</li>
<li>You have experience working in a fully remote position.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are distributed across four offices in Boston, London, Tel Aviv and Ottawa. We've made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others' perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p>Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/" target="_blank">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</a>.) Snyk's unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). We've also raised an additional $200 million, announced September 2020, from investors such as Accel, GV and Boldstart, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk's progress and potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interested?</strong></p>
<p>Please apply below! We care deeply about the warm, inclusive environment we've created and we value diversity - we welcome applications from those typically underrepresented in tech.&nbsp;</p>
