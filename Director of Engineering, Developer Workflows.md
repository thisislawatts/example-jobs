<p><strong>We're looking for a Director of Engineering who can lead Snyk’s efforts across developer workflow experiences like IDEs, version control and CICD.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting to the UK based Senior Director of Engineering, you will partner with the Director of Product for Developer Workflows, to own the top-level company vision and KPIs for this group of products, helping developers shift security left and work where they are - on their desktops and integrated into their check-in, integration and delivery workflows.&nbsp;</span></p>

You will also be working closely with a team of product managers, designers and developers, as well as with our marketing, business development and customer success teams on driving joint efforts in order to reach the highest market impact. The majority of the team live in either Israel or the UK, with some remote workers around Europe and eastern North America.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You care not only about building software right, but building the right thing. Ensuring we are building products that solve problems customers have, in ways they love, that work for the business.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation. Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and the demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has been adopted by over 2.2M developers who use Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we raised $300M in Series E funding, bringing our company valuation to&nbsp; $4.7 billion, after recently securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions with DeepCode &amp; Manifold. On top of that, we have doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us!</span></p>
