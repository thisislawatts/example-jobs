<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is driving developer-first security, and we want you to help! We’re looking for an experienced software architect to join our Product Led Growth group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams in the Growth group focus on acquisition, engagement and conversion of Snyk's individual users. In our work, we focus on business impact:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we analyse the interaction of our users with our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we understand what our users perceive as value in these interactions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we come up with hypotheses on what can increase the value our users gain from our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we experiment iteratively and rapidly to prove or disprove our hypotheses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we implement the proven hypotheses as part of our service</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a software architect, you will own the top-level tech vision for the group, including developing a framework for experimentation, and iterating on it until it’s easy to use, fits the developer mindset/workflow and drives the results we want within the group. From setting high-level direction to collaborating with the engineering teams. You’ll know when to delegate and when to be hands-on. Scale is going to be a big theme for this group, which if successful will increase our user base non-linearly. If we do our job right, teams outside the group will be changing their own processes to think more like a growth team, running experiments as a way to learn and improve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of Snyk’s newest groups, we’re at the beginning of an exciting journey. Where we end up will be largely decided by the people within the group. Come join us if you think you can make a big impact by guiding us on this journey.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enabling &amp; guiding large technical projects with enormous impact for our users across the world</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing the technical vision for Product Led Growth alongside one other architect and communicating it broadly to ensure efforts align with it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advising your leadership team on key technology and product roadmap considerations related to making experimentation cheap, valuable and repeatable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrutinizing and reasoning clearly about the technology and architecture choices made by the group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arbitrating critical decisions correctly that fully consider software best practices, our system realities, and numerous stakeholders’ preferences and concerns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working hands-on with engineers, engineering managers, and product managers as part of a cross-functional product team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching and mentoring our next generation of technical leaders</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have demonstrated the skills needed to work as a Software architect within a team context, influencing and working with others</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have served as the technical lead and defined the roadmap for complex projects spanning multiple teams and functions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure your success in terms of business impact, not lines of code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listen well and internalise the best ideas from all over the organisation. Humbly setting a vision that others are excited to get behind</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also encourage people to come forwards if they haven’t yet demonstrated all these skills, as there will be the opportunity to learn on the job.</span></p>
<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! Snyk reaches more than 2.2 million developers across the globe, positioned within organizations such as Salesforce, Google, and JP Morgan. Our most recent March 2021 Series E funding round valued us at over $4.6 Billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
