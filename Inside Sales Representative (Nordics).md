<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a self-starting, ambitious Inside Sales Representative to team up with our Nordics growth team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source software is booming: technology is integral to almost every facet of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aren’t security experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a developer tooling company with deep security expertise: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organizations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your role</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of our fast-growing sales team, you’ll have great insight into how the full sales-cycle works, exposure to high profile customers, a strong technical grounding in our product, and lots of mentorship and training.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll spend your time:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying, progressing, and closing new sales opportunities for Snyk Open Source, Snyk Container, Snyk Infrastructure as Code and Snyk Code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting your monthly and quarterly pipeline, forecast, and revenue goals, while also maintaining an accurate sales opportunity forecast</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account mapping and lead generation through target account selling, outbound calling, and prospecting marketing-generated inbound leads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating cross-functionally with the marketing team to align on campaign development, lead generation activities, and marketing promotions and events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling Snyk’s unique value proposition to increase sales and expand existing customer usage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping Snyk’s CRM (Salesforce.com) up to date and accurate for your accounts</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care deeply about learning and development, and will support you as you grow. You’ll have opportunities to learn from experienced account execs, including participating in initial demonstrations, and gaining a deep understanding of how multiple selling motions work in a&nbsp; high-growth technology company focussed on security.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should join us if:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience selling license/subscription software to top tier accounts in the Nordics region (minimum of 2 years experience holding a quota)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can express complex, technical, and functional concepts effectively through verbal and written communication</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re driven: you strive to exceed your goals, and love working in a fast-paced environment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are ambitious, organized and energetic</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You build strong, meaningful relationships within and outside the organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are collaborative and want to work in a diverse, high-performing team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are resilient and continually working to be better</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we <a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a> in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
