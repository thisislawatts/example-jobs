<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evangelizing better cultural awareness of open source within Snyk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing key open source leadership both within Snyk and in the wider open source communities</span></li>
