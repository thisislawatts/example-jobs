<p>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.</p>
<h3><strong>The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?</strong></h3>
<p>We’re looking for an experienced and collaborative engineering manager to lead one of our Developer Workflows software development teams, focusing on how Snyk connects with some of our largest Enterprise customers’ on-premise systems (think self-hosted GitHub Enterprise or Bitbucket Server).</p>
<p>If you enjoy the challenge of creating resilient and performant services that scale to meet the needs of Enterprise customers, as well as providing a great developer experience to other engineers who’ll run your software, you’ll love this opportunity.</p>
<p>You’ll bring the best of agile and lean, throw in data-led decisions, and experiment using hypothesis driven development. This will be quite a tiny team, so if you’re the type of engineering manager who also likes to spend part of their time hands-on coding this is the right opportunity for you. Most of Snyk is built using TypeScript and Golang, hosted in Docker containers, running in Kubernetes clusters, on cloud platform infrastructure (both GCP and AWS). This team is no exception. What is a bit more distinct about this team is that they make heavy use of Websockets to provide the connection between Snyk’s systems and the customer’s on-premise systems.</p>
<h3>Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?</h3>
<p>This is a new team that will be split out of an existing team. You’ll be on-boarding with the team currently responsible for our Broker service (the piece that connects Snyk to our customers on-premise systems), developing a plan for taking ownership of and driving this domain, helping the team to become independent, and ultimately helping this team deliver its first improvements to our customers.<br>What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?</p>
<p><strong>People</strong> - you’ll be responsible for the hiring of any new members in your team (currently we’re looking at leveraging existing team members, but this would be in your remit in the future if and when role openings appear), onboarding and training great engineers. You’ll be involved in career development, pay, promotion and performance reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Processes</strong> - you’ll help the team learn, adapt and improve upon agile and lean methodologies. You’ll help the teams understand and maintain a balance between speed of delivery and quality of product. You’ll be responsible for the team’s on-call process and rota, and be a point of escalation for incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Projects</strong> - you’ll be a key part of identifying, measuring and constantly improving the successful behaviour of our customers as they learn about how to set up and maintain the interface between Snyk and their on-premise systems. Again, part of your time will be hands-on coding to help deliver these projects.<br>What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?</p>
<p>Each team at Snyk has an Engineering Manager (you!), and a number of Engineers (2 engineers for this particular Broker team). The team will have a Product Manager. There will also be regular collaboration with Designers and Architects, who often support multiple teams.</p>
<p>You would report to the Engineering Director (based in the UK), who manages all the related teams in the Developer Workflows Group. You’ll also regularly work with their counterpart, the Product Director for the Group (based in Israel).</p>
<p>We are a distributed organisation, and the Developer Workflows Group has members in Israel, UK, and continental Europe. Snyk also has other R&amp;D staff in North America.</p>
<p>While we have a strong culture of collaboration, our teams are empowered and encouraged to set and drive their own direction and priorities - to define how their work will ladder up to our strategic objectives. We don’t have a culture of micro-management. Instead it is a culture of support, coaching, facilitation and deep care.</p>
