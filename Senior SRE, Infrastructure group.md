<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an experienced SRE to join us on our mission to create products and services that make our customers happy and secure. Reliability is right at the heart of enabling that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Senior SRE, you will be responsible for building a culture of high standards around reliability and resilience practices, and paving the road for our observability capabilities at Snyk.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paving the road for internal adoption of our observability, monitoring and logging capabilities that span over multiple clouds and deployment options.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educating our Engineering and Product Management functions about SRE and how to to achieve their reliability goals.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying and driving the build-out of new observability capabilities where gaps exist for our R&amp;D teams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consulting with R&amp;D teams to determine a sensible set of SLIs, overarching SLOs, reasonable error budgets, and the dashboards to monitor against them</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with teams to ensure that monitoring and alerting are instrumented to be customer impact focused. The goal is that no one should get out of bed at 3am for non-customer facing issues.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with vendors to leverage hosted tools into our overall observability stack.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, we’re working with both hosted and self-hosted open source tools. We use Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana, and Jaeger alongside other Kubernetes utilities and cloud facilities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working very closely with Infra Group’s Cloud Platforms team to ensure that our practices and capabilities are adopted as far and wide throughout the organisation as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a framework for assessing Production Readiness, and working with R&amp;D teams to meet this bar.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe that DevOps and SRE are part of the company culture, not a role.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have hands-on experience as a Site Reliability Engineer working in company cultures that encouraged a strong team ownership model (“you build it, you run it”).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are willing to inspect and challenge the status quo. You aim to discover fresh ideas on how appropriate reliability is achieved, adopted at scale, and how it drives organisation-wide culture change.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience with reducing toil required by internal teams through building and maintaining automation and observability tooling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate proactively, enjoy consulting directly with individuals and teams across multiple disciplines to achieve their observability and reliability goals.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have seen good (and bad) infrastructure, and have opinions about what works and what doesn’t.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are hands-on, curious and love to explore new domains, technologies, and approaches.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are agile and enjoy the speed of a fast-paced, highly engaged environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have designed and instrumented distributed tracing telemetry and visualizations across big, complex codebases to drive insights and outcomes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience running and operating software on Kubernetes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience with running Prometheus and Grafana for multiple clusters and environments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p>We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</p>
<p>We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</p>
<p>In March of 2021, we&nbsp;<a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a>&nbsp;in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</p>
