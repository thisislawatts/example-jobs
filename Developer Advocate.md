<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a passionate, hands-on developer advocate to join our Developer Relations team to educate, empower and enable developers in application security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Relations team collaborates closely with developers to raise awareness of the importance of security in the application lifecycle, educating them through content, engineering, presentations, videos etc. about application security and pragmatic best practices they can use.</span></p>
<h2><strong>As a Developer Advocate at Snyk:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to apply good security practices in a software development lifecycle. You’ll use that knowledge to help developers in the community learn more about the role security plays in their applications and level up their security practices.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing awareness of the Snyk container platform</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educating open-source users and communities about the importance of DevSecOps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">producing great multimedia security content in a variety of different media : blog posts, videos, podcasts, cheat-sheets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing integrations and plugins to help users interact with Snyk in different environments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working closely together with our partners, customers, the development, product and marketing teams, and of course the broader developer communities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split evenly between London and Tel Aviv. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have developed applications, integrations, plugins in Java, Node/JS or similar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pride yourself on the quality and accessibility of your writing and teaching.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are at your best when immersed around developers and their communities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about both security and open source software, and are excited about learning how to live-hack demo repos!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are hands-on, curious and love to learn as well as educate</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h3>

</ul>
