<p><strong>Solutions Engineer Intern (For 2020 or 2021 university graduates)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Community Outreach internship program was first designed and launched during the Covid-19 pandemic, when we were particularly concerned on the disproportionate economic impact of the pandemic on women and under-represented communities. </strong><strong>We want to leverage the incredible growth and success we have experienced at Snyk to play our role in supporting women and under-represented minorities who have graduated either in 2020/2021. The internship program allows minority groups with career opportunities while simultaneously aligning with our own talent growth strategy as a company.</strong></p>
