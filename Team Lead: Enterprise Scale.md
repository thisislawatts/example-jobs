<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an experienced, capable team lead to join one of our engineering teams and help us build our core product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be joining the Enterprise scale team, building functionality for our largest customers, and ensuring that our product is performant and easy to use at scale. You know how to empower and motivate your team members, facilitate discussion to improve the outcome of features, and measure complexity in order to predictably deliver high value solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work with Agile software development methodology on our engineering teams; additionally, every team is distributed between Tel Aviv and London. Every so often (around 2-3 months) you will also be working with developers from other teams as part of a shared weekly on-call rotation, keeping our production system healthy and gaining a better understanding of our customer needs; you will work with two or three other developers at a time. </span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coding for approximately 40% of your time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentoring and enabling team members by coaching them and providing them with regular feedback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping track of the team's delivery quality, and the team’s technical and process debt</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiring for positions on the team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping track of the team's progress against the sprint plan and rally the team to resolve unforeseen circumstances</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicating proactively and setting realistic expectations inside and outside the team </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping out with customer support, guided by our customer success managers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split evenly between London and Tel Aviv. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
