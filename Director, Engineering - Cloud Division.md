<div class="content-intro"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, the world gets more digital thanks to tens of millions of developers building the future faster than ever. But with exponential growth comes exponential risk, as outnumbered security teams struggle to secure mountains of code. This is where Snyk (pronounced “sneak”) comes in. Snyk is a developer security platform that makes it easy for development teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and cloud infrastructure — and do it all right from the start. Snyk is on a mission to make the world a more secure place by empowering developers to develop fast and stay secure.</span></p></div><p class="p1"><strong><em><sub>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.</sub></em></strong></p>

You’ll work closely with your colleagues in Product, GTM, and Engineering to build on this foundation, establishing a high-performing, business-impact-driven vision, strategy, and execution plan. You’ll lead the teams and support the Engineering Managers in development, and will be supporting the teams to deliver against our vision and strategy.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Processes </strong>- you’ll help the teams learn, adapt, and improve upon agile, and lean development methodologies. You’ll help the teams understand and maintain a balance between speed of delivery and quality of the product.

<h3 class="p3"><strong>What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1">The Cloud Group comprises related teams focused on different areas of Cloud security from scanning engines, to developer experience, to cloud integrations. The Engineering Director will work closely with the group's Product Director and manage an Architect and several Engineering Managers who support Engineers aligned to each of those business goals.

<p class="p1">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span class="s1">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a>). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). We also raised an additional $200 Million, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-200m-to-modernize-security-industry/"><span class="s1">announced on September 9, 2020</span></a>, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</p>
<p class="p1">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure</p><div class="content-conclusion"><p><em data-stringify-type="italic">We care deeply about the warm, inclusive environment we’ve created and we value diversity – we welcome applications from those typically underrepresented in tech.
