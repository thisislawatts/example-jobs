<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We're looking for an experienced technical support engineer with a proactive and curious approach to problem-solving to join our Customer Success &amp; Support team, helping us to provide prompt and delightful technical support to the developers who use Snyk.</span></p>
<p><strong>Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The use of open source is booming, but</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our product enables developers and enterprise security to find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies, without slowing down development. Snyk integrates seamlessly into developer workflows so that security becomes business as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 300,000 developers depend on Snyk to keep their software secure. We have many large organizations on board, including Disney, Google, New Relic, and ASOS, and we are growing rapidly.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Technical Support Engineer on our Customer Support team, you’ll be the first line of defense against technical support issues that arrive via email, chat and Github issues. You will work with the Tier 2 team and our talented core engineering team to help solve Snyk’s customer issues. You will be working directly with active and prospective Snyk customers every day, building and maintaining their trust, whilst balancing the needs of enterprise and self-service customers alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only technical support engineer for our technical support team, you will also play a key role in building a solid relationship with our enterprise and large accounts through steady and helpful communications and guidance each and every day!</span></p>
<h3><strong>You'll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding, reproducing and resolving complicated technical issues that our customers have raised.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diving into our codebase, primarily written with </span><strong>NodeJS/Typescript, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to figure out where the issue lies, and what a good solution might look like.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing expert communication, ensuring that every user knows exactly when they’ll hear back from us and providing regular updates while solving their problem.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to our users’ needs, listening for recurring requests, and representing their voice in daily meetings with the Tier 2 and engineering teams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contributing to building up a best-in-class technical support function, including writing customer documentation and FAQs, building dashboards, or designing integrations between tools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, we’d love for you to have ambitions to develop your career as a developer or as a technical expert within Snyk!</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are fluent in English&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have some experience as a developer or in a similar role.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You enjoy working with others’ code and have used GitHub or other source control tools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love helping people and care deeply about providing an excellent customer experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You take a logical approach to solving problems and prioritization.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a clear communicator, both verbally and in writing, and you enjoy explaining things to others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are curious: you love to explore new challenges, but also know when you need guidance from someone with more domain experience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re interested in security or open source software, and you believe in our mission.</span></li>
