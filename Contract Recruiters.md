<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk, the cloud native application security leader, has a vision to empower every modern developer in the world to develop fast and stay secure. Only Snyk provides a platform to secure all of the critical components of today’s cloud native application development including the code, open source libraries, container infrastructure and infrastructure as code. Snyk’s security platform is built on an industry-leading proprietary vulnerability database, maintained by an expert security research team, that currently powers strategic partners such as Datadog, Docker, IBM Cloud, Rapid7, Red Hat and Trend Micro. The company works with global customers of all sizes to empower developers to automatically integrate security throughout their existing workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named to the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#36abffd55f94"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Forbes Cloud 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the definitive ranking of the top 100 private cloud companies in the world, Snyk was also recently recognized by Comparably as the #3 small-to-medium business for </span><a href="https://www.comparably.com/news/happiest-employees-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happiest Employees in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
