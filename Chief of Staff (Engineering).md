<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an experienced and highly motivated Chief of Staff to join our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">team and partner with our SVP of Engineering in strategic, tactical, and organization capacities to help deliver the world’s leading cloud native application security platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snyk </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team partners with our Product team to build and continuously improve our platform and our products. We embody the company values: We Ship It, work as One Team, Care Deeply about our customers and our teammates, and are Ridiculously Easy to Work With. In the past 12 months, the team has added two exciting new products, and significantly advanced the design of our platform. We have also added two acquisitions which are predominantly staffed with engineering talent, and have more than doubled our engineering team footprint to 125, with plans to grow to nearly 200 by year end..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a successful and impactful Chief of Staff, you understand business context and functional priorities and dynamics, and can be a driver of impact. You can operate independently to achieve outcomes, are excellent at prioritization and time management, and have tremendous attention to detail so that none of the most important areas of responsibilit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y are left wanting. You’ll use those skills in a direct reporting partnership with our London based SVP of Engineering to achieve short and long term company and engineering goals, and you’ll play a critical role in the success of this company.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaling the impact of engineering leadership by providing strategic, tactical, and organizational assistance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping to drive engineering execution, using context gained from direct participation in engineering leadership meetings and communication.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attending to the highest priority items that affect the entire engineering function, rather than one particular group.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assisting in defining improvements in process and policy to stay one step ahead of our rapid growth, and making sure those improvements are implemented.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acting autonomously towards achieving goals, rather than being given a daily list of tasks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working most closely with our SVP of Engineering, but partnering with other engineering leaders to drive success of the function.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have proven experience organizing and acting as an air traffic controller for multiple leaders and groups.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are an excellent communicator in written and verbal form</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are extremely driven, versatile, and dedicated to efficient productivity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience planning and organizing strategic initiatives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about the details, and achieving success in your areas of focus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appreciate a fast moving, energetic, and collaborative environment with a team that is ridiculously easy to work with</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have previous Chief of Staff experience in a technically oriented role</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and/or have been a very successful Executive Assistant in a role where the expectations were less tactical and more self driven, strategic, and organizational.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have confidence in your ability to scale the effectiveness of engineering leadership to a very high degree.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we have teams across multiple offices, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. We make heavy use of video calls and Slack to stay connected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripe, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
