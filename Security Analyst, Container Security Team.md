<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, many technologies powering containers, such as some Linux distributions, are open source and rely on open source packages.&nbsp; These packages are out there in the world, visible for anyone, and within that code there are vulnerabilities.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring our containers vulnerabilities database to make sure of its accuracy by creating and managing a variety of dashboards, using tools such as Python, Looker, Grafana and DataStudio</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using data analyst techniques to answer research questions about vulnerabilities, and general threat intelligence trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing and testing theories and hypotheses around new areas that Snyk tackles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop our product to further achieve our mission</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing and maintaining relationships with&nbsp; Linux distributions security teams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining and developing the new features and KPIs in our Container&nbsp; products</span></li>
</ul>
