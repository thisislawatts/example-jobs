<p><strong>Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source and stay secure</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Open source is an exponentially growing opportunity but security is a key concern: taking code written by others, often with little to no vetting of its security pedigree, can put companies at significant risk. Snyk protects companies by enabling developers and enterprise teams to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source code.  We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users, and we are proud to be built by the best developers and security researchers in the space. </span></p>
