<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a driven, analytical, and creative financial analyst to join our FP&amp;A team to help us drive rapid growth in our software business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FP&amp;A team is tasked with accurate and timely board reporting and is a trusted resource for executive decision making. The team collaborates closely with the accounting team, sales ops team, recruiting team, and all members of executive leadership. This year the team developed the 2020 company-wide operating plan, including all headcount phasing, major investments, and marketing program spends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to tell a story using PowerPoint and Excel. You’ll use your knowledge of finance and economics to support your hypotheses on our company performance. Here at Snyk, you’ll learn how to take a question and turn it into a packaged and polished answer ready for executive decision making.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzing SaaS productivity metrics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benchmarking company performance against industry comparables</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicating budget to actuals to department leaders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing business cases for where we can improve our performance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking large data sets and crafting them into a compelling narrative for decision making</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are a whizz with Excel (we move fast and do not have time to teach you)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can operate in ambiguity (we are a start-up!)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are not afraid to ask others for help</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are willing to pick up the phone and talk to someone to get to the bottom of something instead of trading emails</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about the accuracy of reporting numbers and feel it is representative of our group’s credibility </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are hands-on, curious and love to explore new domains and technologies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have worked in either consulting, investment banking, private equity, or at a software company</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also raised an additional $70 Million, </span><a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-open-source-security-platform-snyk-raises-70m-1001300189"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced September 10, 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  from investors such as Accel, GV and Boldstart, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What does our interview process look like?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start by having a video call to get to know you. We’ll tell you more about us, more about the FP&amp;A team, and why our culture is so great! We also want to hear about you, your skills and experience, and why you are interested in exploring Snyk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there we’ll have an onsite interview where you will get to visit our office, meet a few different members of the team, and find out everything you need to know about the way we work.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To finish we’ll have one final video call with you to wrap up the process!</span></p>
