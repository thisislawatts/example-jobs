<p><strong>Location: North America, Remote North America</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to build security into development – the only way security can scale. To get such dev adoption, we built a dev tooling company, not a cyber company. We’re looking to delight and engage developers as we help them secure what they build. This approach spans the entire company, from product to commercial to community – which is where you come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a driven, charismatic, and security-conscious leader to join our Developer Relations team to build, execute, and grow a new Developer Education function. This person will create and teach educational developer, devops, and security-focused workshops and content (articles, videos, courses), and will act as a public representative for Snyk in the developer, devops, and security communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Developer Education team’s mission is to arm developers, devops, and appsec practitioners with the latest and greatest information and techniques to help keep their applications and users secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to build secure applications from the ground up, how to deploy software securely, and how to fix common OWASP top 10-style vulnerabilities in applications while dreaming. You’ll use that knowledge to build world-class educational materials (workshops, courses, articles, and videos) and eventually grow a team to help you. You will inspire your audiences about the importance of security and teach them how to integrate security into their day to day workflows. Here at Snyk, you’ll build a new Developer Education function and help contribute to the business’s rapid growth.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building and evolving educational content and presentations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading interactive, security-focused workshops where you’ll teach developers how to fix and prevent common security issues</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being a thought leader in the wider Developer and Security Relations group and helping the team with ideas and strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating a following by participating in the developer, devops, and security communities as a public representative for Snyk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing and growing the new Developer Education function and team members</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborating with sales and marketing to strategically grow Snyk’s product business</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are a skilled, passionate developer with in-depth knowledge of web security (OWASP, common vulnerabilities, authentication, authorization, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can communicate and connect well with developers, security practitioners, and technology leaders, both in prepared content and live activities, such as events, roundtable discussions, and meetings, as well as in more informal settings such as social media or in person conversation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are curious, hands-on, and love to keep up with the latest and greatest happenings in the development and security world</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pride yourself on the quality and accessibility of your writing and teaching</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience building courses, workshops, and interactive forms of educational content</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience leading a team, tracking performance metrics, and collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have flawless written and verbal communication skills&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have led security-focused workshops and courses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are active in the developer, devops, or security communities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience with scheduling automation and Salesforce</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation. Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and the demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has been adopted by over 2.2M developers who use Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we raised $300M in Series E funding, bringing our company valuation to&nbsp; $4.7 billion, only 6 months after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing three strategic acquisitions with DeepCode, Manifold &amp; FossID. On top of that, we have doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
