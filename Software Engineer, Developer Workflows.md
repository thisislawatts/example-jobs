<h3><em><strong><sub>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.</sub></strong></em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for collaborative engineers of all levels to join our team and help Snyk write software to keep our customers secure!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Source Control Management (SCM) team is responsible for the critical backbone of connectivity for the millions of developers that integrate Snyk with their SCM systems like Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab and more. You’ll build the user experiences and supporting infrastructure that powers importing projects, creating Pull Requests and native experiences. The work will be instrumental to supporting the company's expansion as well as offering an amazing developer experience to those using Snyk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming months, depending on your interests and skills, you will be instrumental in projects such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a best-in-class Pull Request life-cycle, allowing developers to stay secure by giving them insight into issues that affect their code and the steps to fix them</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving and re-architecting a system that provides secure, stable and scalable connectivity to privately-hosted SCMs at a rate of hundreds of requests per second (if you have experience in network programming, particularly with WebSockets, we’d love to hear about it!)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating native SCM App experiences for GitHub and Bitbucket so that developers can take action without leaving their workflow</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your day-to-day:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of your time will be spent pairing with the team to write high-quality code with excellent test coverage using TypeScript. You can expect to be the owner and take accountability for the quality of your code</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work alongside the Product Manager, your teammates and stakeholders on upcoming features, from ideation through to development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborate on the future vision of systems and their architecture. Our architects work within teams, not separate to them</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once designed and implemented, you will see these changes through to Production by continuously delivering small, high quality changes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll join a team who like to learn from experiences and adapt our ways of working. We’re always looking for ways to improve and look forward to you contributing to that</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a collaborative and supportive team, you’ll grow more junior engineers through pairing, feedback and mentoring</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We value building a team with a diverse set of backgrounds and experience. This list is not an exhaustive list of skills we're looking for, nor should you feel like you need to meet all of them to apply!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a distributed team, and many of us work from home or in our offices. Your colleagues are based in the UK and Israel, while others in the wider group are also based in Germany, Switzerland, Czech Rep., Canada and the US.&nbsp;</span></p>
