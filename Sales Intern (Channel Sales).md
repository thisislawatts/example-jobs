<h5><strong>Community Outreach Program: Internships for underrepresented groups </strong><em><strong>who have/will graduate in 2020/2021</strong></em></h5>
<p>Our Community Outreach internship program was first designed and launched during the Covid-19 pandemic, when we were particularly concerned on the disproportionate economic impact of the pandemic on women and under-represented communities.</p>
<p>We want to leverage the incredible growth and success we have experienced at Snyk to play our role in supporting women and under-represented minorities. The internship program allows minority groups with career opportunities while simultaneously aligning with our own talent growth strategy as a company.</p>
