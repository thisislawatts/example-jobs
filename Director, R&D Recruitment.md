<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp; Snyk was just named #15 on </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/these-are-the-2021-cnbc-disruptor-50-companies.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC’s 2021 Disruptor 50 Companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has been adopted by over 2.2M developers (including multiple leading enterprise customers) who use Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we raised $300M in Series E funding, bringing our company valuation to&nbsp; $4.7 billion, only 6 months after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020; successfully closing three strategic acquisitions with DeepCode, Manifold and FossID; recorded a 200% year-on-year increase in revenue; and launched two new products.&nbsp; On top of that, we have doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!&nbsp;</span></p>
