<h3><em><strong><sub>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.</sub></strong></em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a collaborative software engineer to join our team and help our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developers write software to keep our customers secure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our group we introduce and improve support for dev tools, languages, package managers, source code management and more.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've used </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">snyk test</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the command line, have your GitHub code tested in the snyk web app, or use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">snyk monitor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your CI pipeline - that's us!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll join a team that owns the future product direction, development, and operational reliability of this service. You’ll be coding across the stack, mostly with TypeScript and JavaScript.&nbsp;</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">talking to our customers, collaborating with your team to build a product they truly love</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining and supporting a high quality, reliable, fast service for customers, at scale</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuously delivering small, high quality changes to production, at a sustainable pace</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing relationships with open source contributors—reviewing and incorporating their contributions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating in a paid on-call rotation (currently one week every two months)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">either have experience working with TypeScript/JavaScript, or are a polyglot with experience learning a new language</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand the importance of automated testing (maybe with experience in TDD) and code quality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritise collaboration, pair programming, and code reviews</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work sustainably and iteratively, delivering high quality code using continuous delivery</span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>About Snyk</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we <a href="https://snyk.io/news/snyk-advances-developer-first-security-with-series-e-investment/" target="_blank">raised $300M</a> in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.&nbsp; Join us!</span></p>
