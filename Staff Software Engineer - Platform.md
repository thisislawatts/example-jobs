<div class="content-intro"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, the world gets more digital thanks to tens of millions of developers building the future faster than ever. But with exponential growth comes exponential risk, as outnumbered security teams struggle to secure mountains of code. This is where Snyk (pronounced “sneak”) comes in. Snyk is a developer security platform that makes it easy for development teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and cloud infrastructure — and do it all right from the start. Snyk is on a mission to make the world a more secure place by empowering developers to develop fast and stay secure.</span></p></div><hr>

<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a number of smart, caring and proactive senior software engineers to join our core platform teams, to help our enterprise customers understand their security posture, and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams in the Platform Group aim to build a scalable, extensible platform that is used by both our Snyk product offering teams and our Enterprise customers to solve complex challenges, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">processing analysis output to enrich the context of vulnerabilities and other issues within the enterprise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onboarding large developer teams onto our multi-tenant SaaS offering</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying policies that ease security compliance as an integral part of the software development lifecycle process</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the teams will extend our ability to onboard customers 100x times larger than we have now; redesign and replatform our reporting offering from the ground up and build a large-scale issues management system, to allow deeper insights into potential risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Snyk, you’ll use your knowledge and passion as a developer, along with your problem solving skills to help us develop software that, in turn, helps others to develop software that is and remains secure.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging in problem analysis and collaborating with product to create plans that continue to delight our current users and win new ones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executing on those plans by coding across the full stack</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace, in two-week sprints&nbsp;</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company we are distributed across four offices in London, Romania, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
