<p><strong>Location: Singapore</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a Driven Account Expansion Rep to join our Renewal and Expansion Team. This Expansion Rep will collaborate closely with both our SMB and Commercial clients along with our internal Sales Force and Technical Customer Success Teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This team is heavily focused on expanding and renewing customers by engaging early-on, before subscription anniversaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The health of the existing customer base is crucial when retaining the dollars that have already been closed. The Technical Customer Success Managers will drive adoption and user satisfaction which will aid in the efforts for the renewal and expansion team to grow the account. Prioritizing by expiring deal size, runway for growth as well as imminent anniversary dates, the expansion rep will use these indicators to uncover and close expansion opportunities at the time of the renewal.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building strong relationships with our existing client base from the SMB and Commercial Market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mapping out how these organisations work: identifying how development and Security teams interact, understand the importance of internal processes for securing their company’s open source code, and comprehend how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within the org.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a proactive and forward-thinker when it comes to new features and products our engineering teams release, and introducing these to existing clients</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborating closely with our Sales Reps and our Technical Customer Success team to identify the health and areas of growth within an account to identify expansion and upsell opportunities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience managing multiple accounts and maintaining strong, positive relationships with existing clients</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand the software developer lifecycle and can articulate how a developer tooling product might fit in</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a track record of identifying and executing on upsell opportunities in existing deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand people: what makes them tick, what their attitude is to us, when they’re most likely to want to buy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are organized, rigorous, and love to improve processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a startup on its way to success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced, collaborative teams</span></li>
</ul>
