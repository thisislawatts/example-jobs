<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an experienced technical writer to join our Design team to lead and own all our user-facing documentation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this role, you will aim to elevate our technical content, its organization and the processes to a world-class standard, and collaborate closely with our Product, Engineering, and Customer Success teams as we go to market with new features and capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be skilled in crafting clear and concise copy, being the filter between our internal jargon and being empathetic to our wide range of users and those who do not have English as their first language. At Snyk you will be guiding readers through tasks such as setting up integrations, how to use our CLI and API, and how our product handles different programming languages and package managers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">handling the full process of planning and writing documentation and video scripts, right through to publishing it on our site</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting regularly with our customer success team to highlight areas where our users are struggling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identifying where improvements to our documentation will add the most value, and working to achieve this</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">establishing a workable, repeatable process that empowers our teams to work at pace while keeping the quality high&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviewing our product and giving input on where we can give better instructions that would avoid the need for separate documentation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning and updating our style guide to ensure our language, terminology and tone of voice is consistent throughout our product</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience in defining a content strategy to support different audiences&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience in enabling agile product teams to write high quality content</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience of writing documentation for technical products for developer tooling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have managed the user experience of a large documentation site and can clearly show the role you played in making it great</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can write in a way that is easy for developers with a range of abilities to understand</span></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are proactive and collaborative in the way you work</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we have teams across multiple offices, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q4 2019 alone, Snyk had already over 110,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $150 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripe, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
