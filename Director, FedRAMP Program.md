<div class="content-intro"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, the world gets more digital thanks to tens of millions of developers building the future faster than ever. But with exponential growth comes exponential risk, as outnumbered security teams struggle to secure mountains of code. This is where Snyk (pronounced “sneak”) comes in. Snyk is a developer security platform that makes it easy for development teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and cloud infrastructure — and do it all right from the start. Snyk is on a mission to make the world a more secure place by empowering developers to develop fast and stay secure.</span></p></div><hr>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is used by millions of developers, driven by its successful freemium motion (unique in the security industry) and its focus on putting the developer first. We secure the code you write with Snyk Code, the libraries you depend upon with Snyk Open Source, the containers you package it all into with Snyk Container and the infrastructure that you run it on with Snyk Infrastructure as Code. This analysis relies on deep application &amp; security intelligence - knowing the right security questions to ask, and thoroughly understanding the application to be able to answer them. Our leading vulnerability database and our machine-learning based program analysis are key for delivering on our promise of securing software, and a huge factor in our commercial success.</span></p>
