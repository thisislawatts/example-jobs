<p><strong>We're looking for a driven Expansions &amp; Renewals Representative to join our Team. This Rep will collaborate closely with both our SMB and Commercial clients along with our internal Salesforce and Technical Customer Success teams. </strong></p>
<p>The use of open source software is booming: technology is integral to almost every facet of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects aren't security experts. But we are. </p>
<p>We're a developer tooling company with deep security expertise: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in. </p>
<p>We're focused on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers. </p>
<h2>Your Role</h2>
<p>This team is heavily focused on expanding and renewing customers by engaging early-on, before subscription anniversaries. The health of the existing customer base is crucial when retaining the dollars that have already been closed. The Technical Customer Success Managers will drive adoption and user satisfaction which will aid in the efforts for the Expansion &amp; Renewal team to grow the account. Prioritising by expiring deal size, runway for growth as well as imminent anniversary dates, this Expansions &amp; Renewals Representative will use these indicators to uncover and close expansion opportunities. </p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Building strong relationships with our existing client base from the SMB and Commercial Market.</li>
<li>Mapping out how these organisations work: identifying how development and Security teams interact, understand the importance of internal processes for securing their company's open source code, and comprehend how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within the org. </li>
<li>Becoming a proactive and forward-thinker when it comes to new features and products our Engineering teams release, and introducing these to existing clients. </li>
<li>Collaborating closely with our Sales Reps and our Technical Customer Success team to identify the health and areas of growth within an account to identify expansion and up-sell opportunities. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We've made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each other's perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what's happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel. </p>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience in Account Management, Sales or Customer Success.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience managing dozens of accounts and maintaining strong, positive relationships with existing clients</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a firm understanding of the importance for a land, expand and retain model.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand the software developer lifecycle and can articulate how a developer tooling product might fit in</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a track record of identifying and executing on upsell opportunities in existing deals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand people: what makes them tick, what their attitude is to us, when they’re most likely to want to buy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re organised, rigorous, and adaptable to an ever evolving process and team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a rocketship on its way to success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced, collaborative teams.</span></li>
