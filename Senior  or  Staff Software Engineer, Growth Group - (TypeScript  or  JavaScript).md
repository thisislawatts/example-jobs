<div class="content-intro"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, the world gets more digital thanks to tens of millions of developers building the future faster than ever. But with exponential growth comes exponential risk, as outnumbered security teams struggle to secure mountains of code. This is where Snyk (pronounced “sneak”) comes in. Snyk is a developer security platform that makes it easy for development teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and cloud infrastructure — and do it all right from the start. Snyk is on a mission to make the world a more secure place by empowering developers to develop fast and stay secure.</span></p></div><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for impact driven, experienced Senior or Staff software engineers to join our Growth group and amplify the value Snyk is bringing to developers all around the world.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teams in the Growth group focus on acquisition, engagement and conversion of Snyk's individual users. In our work, we are motivated by making a business impact:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we analyse the interaction of our users with our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we understand what our users perceive as value in these interactions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we come up with hypotheses on what can increase the value our users gain from our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we experiment iteratively and rapidly to prove or disprove our hypotheses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we implement the proven hypotheses as part of our service</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We build on top of the entire Snyk product offering – Snyk Open Source, Snyk Container, Snyk IaC and Snyk Code. We build on top of the Platform that powers these product offerings. We focus on user behaviour and business metrics that drive the most important needles for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the teams in the Growth group will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extend our reach to the individual developer, exponentially growing new user registrations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase the engagement of our users, making sure more and more registered users get value out of Snyk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce user churn, helping users make value over longer periods of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drive conversion, helping business users emerge from our free tier and onboard to Snyk as a customer company</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Who are you?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a versatile, experienced software engineer. You pick the right tool for the job, starting from the end result you want to achieve. Your motivation lies more with your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">business</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">technical</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impact. You thrive on multi-disciplinary teams, working alongside marketers, designers and data analysts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll spend your time:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identifying user behaviour through analytics in a rigorous and trustworthy way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coming up with hypotheses on how user behaviour can change with our service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing changes across our entire product surface</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measuring the impact of these changes to prove or disprove these hypotheses</span></li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer to disprove a theory quickly rather than exhaust all ways trying to prove it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are comfortable with Git, GitHub and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment workflows</span></li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h3>
