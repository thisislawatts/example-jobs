<p>We’re looking for a collaborative, hard-working account exec to join our sales team.</p>
<p>The use of open source software is growing rapidly: technology is a core part of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects <a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact">aren’t security experts</a>. But our team is.</p>
<p>We’re a developer tooling company with deep security knowledge: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</p>
<p>We’re focussed on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</p>
<h2>Your role</h2>
<p>As a member of our sales team, you’ll play a meaningful role in laying the foundations for our future success. You’ll work closely with your sales colleagues and our talented sales engineers. We’re a collaborative team with different backgrounds, and we spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team.</p>
<p>As an account exec at Snyk, you’ll be responsible for the end-to-end sales cycle for prospective customers, taking warm inbound leads, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders in the devsecops space and digital transformation teams at companies. Our existing customer base ranges from mid-market companies like right up to large enterprises like Google and Salesforce.</p>
<p>We want you to contribute to the iterative improvement of our sales process, tone and approach, and you’ll have plenty of scope to inform the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>We’re looking for highly motivated salespeople who thrive with the freedom to decide how to spend your day, and how best to contribute to your team’s goals.</p>
<h2>You should join us if:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have experience selling a technical product, and you want to hone your craft in a startup on its way to success</li>
<li>You’re self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy working in fast-paced environments</li>
<li>You are collaborative and love belonging to a high-achieving sales team</li>
<li>You are resilient: you believe mistakes and failures are learning opportunities, and you value feedback</li>
<li>You’re open, honest and take an entrepreneurial approach to sales, mindful of your customer’s risk tolerance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interested?</h2>
<p>We'd love to hear from you!</p>
<p>We’re deeply committed to our healthy, inclusive culture and are working hard to nurture a diverse team at Snyk; we particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role, but are not totally sure whether you’re the right person, do apply anyway or reach out to <a href="mailto:maria@snyk.io">maria@snyk.io</a> or <a href="mailto:ethan@snyk.io">ethan@snyk.io</a> (who’ll be your manager, should you choose to join us!).</p>
