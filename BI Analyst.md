<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a passionate BI analyst to join our Business Intelligence team to help build a culture of data-driven decision-making across the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to make sure data is accurate, well-organized, and accessible. You’ll use that knowledge to collaborate with internal stakeholders to shape the tools and infrastructure we use to support the data needs of our business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Snyk you’ll work with teams such as marketing, finance, and sales, to ensure everyone can measure and monitor the metrics that matter to them by determining what data we should analyze, so we can implement reports and encourage the growth of our data-driven environment. </span></p>
<h2><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supporting customer success with engagement measurements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generating dashboards and reporting to different departments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracking progress against internal goals through KPIs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reorganizing and connecting data from different datasets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping track of the pipeline and forecasting tooling for our enterprise sales team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracking the usage of new product features to determine whether they are meeting our expectations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting all billing and collections data to our finance team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building reporting for our marketing funnel</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work in geographically distributed teams, generally split evenly between London and Tel Aviv. We use Slack &amp; Zoom to keep in contact with one another, and you’ll travel around twice a year to spend time with colleagues who aren’t co-located with you.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">care deeply about helping others to make data-driven decisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited about using your analytical skills to help steer our fast-growing company to success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can translate business problems into SQL queries</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">know your way around Google Analytics (Advantage)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are collaborative, hands-on, and self-motivated</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have strong communication skills</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are at your best when you’re working with data flows</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have worked with charting and BI tools, and you know which tools suit which purpose</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What does our interview process look like?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start by having a video call to get to know you. We’ll tell you more about us, the role, and why our culture is so great! We also want to hear about you, your skills and experience, and why you are interested in exploring Snyk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up we’ll send you a take home exercise. Ideally, you will get it back to us within a week and we can take a look at your work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there we’ll have an onsite interview where you will get to visit our office, meet a few different members of the BI team, and other stakeholders either in person or over Zoom, and find out everything you need to know about the way we work. </span></p>
