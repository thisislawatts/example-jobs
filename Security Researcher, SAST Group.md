<h3><em><strong><sub>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.</sub></strong></em></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a curious, analytical and detail-oriented analyst to join our team and help us uncover</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unknown vulnerabilities that exist in open source.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source software is booming: technology is integral to almost every facet of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Our product enables developers to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies, without slowing down development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re proud of our industry-leading vulnerability database - it is the engine that powers our products. As part of our security team you’ll focus on growing and improving our knowledge of the vulnerabilities that exist in open source software.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, much of any project’s code relies on open source packages. These are out there in the world, visible for anyone, and within that code there are vulnerabilities. As part of our security team, you’ll join us on our mission to continually improve our ability to find these open source vulnerabilities in a programmatic way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You’ll spend your time</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discovering potential vulnerabilities that haven’t yet been identified or ‘published’</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using research to verify or disqualify potential vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building SAST rulesets to identify vulnerability types and frameworks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">triaging vulnerabilities to identify the underlying vulnerable code and functionality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing and testing theories and hypotheses around new areas that Snyk tackles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop our product to further achieve our mission</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You should apply if</strong>:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience working in the security space and researching vulnerabilities</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re comfortable working with large datasets (we use BigQuery; ideally you’ll have used one of BigQuery, elasticsearch, kibana, hadoop etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You love to automate your work, through writing your own scripts (we mainly use Python and JavaScript)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re excited about working in an area where we don’t even know what the answer looks like</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have worked closely with Data Scientists in the past and have experience working with ML</span></li>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By September 2020, Snyk was already adopted by over 1.5M developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). Our September 2020 Series D funding round of $200M has put us at over $2.5Billion company valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
