<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senior Technical Program Manager will collaborate with all of Snyk’s departments to support the evaluation, implementation and operation of technology initiatives across all departments, as well as the rollout of systems and integrations to support our fast growing company in its adoption of new systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for a leader that will define and create much of our approach to cross-functional planning, management and delivery. You are not stepping into a clean, well-defined role. You are the “prototype” for the cross-functional program management function at Snyk; the one who will help us figure out how to plan, execute and communicate this work to all of Snyk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll help us to implement Federal programs like FedRAMP Accreditation, large-scale sales efficiency programs, and potentially infrastructure initiatives that cross multiple departments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering closely with Snyk business stakeholders to ensure we are accurately translating internal needs into well defined programs, projects and backlogs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking and reporting on programs / projects and their associated KPIs&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating templates for reliable, repeatable execution of initiatives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating from the top to the bottom of the organization about priorities, status, blockers and risks of your programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing multiple initiatives of varying size and scale at any given time</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have proven experience in being a technical program/project manager at a startup and/or growth-mode organization. Public company experience is a plus (pre- and post-IPO even better!)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience in Agile methodologies. Ideally, you’re deep in Agile and have a strong understanding of roles, approaches, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience in building platforms and products for internal customers, with the ability to drive adoption of these products</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience collaborating with multiple stakeholders and managing priorities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are user-focussed and enjoy building effective relationships with stakeholders at all levels of the company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are able to adapt in a fast-paced environment, with the ability to manage competing priorities and multi-task</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate proactively, effectively, and enjoy working with people from multiple disciplines across engineering, marketing, sales, security, HR and finance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience in working in a geographically distributed / remote environment. You can set and manage your own work without direction from others. You are comfortable and experienced working asynchronously (Slack, written docs, other collaboration and communication tools).</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps, and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2020 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 600,000 developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS, and others). We also raised an additional $150 Million,</span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-150m/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced January 21st, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from investors such as Stripes and Salesforce Ventures, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open-source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure</span></p>
