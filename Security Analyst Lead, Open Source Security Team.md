<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an experienced, analytical, and collaborative Security Analyst Operations Lead to join our team and help us build the best DB of open source vulnerabilities out there.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern software development, much of any project's code relies on open-source packages. These packages are visible for anyone, and within that code there are vulnerabilities.

Every day new vulnerabilities and updates are published that require processing and triage in order to be added to the Snyk Vulnerability DB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your role will be to take charge of a squad of analysts who will be conducting this work. You’ll lead the effort of maintaining our DB, monitoring our workflows, and shaping our processes, to make sure we continue to have the most accurate, timely, and informative open source vulnerability DB in the market.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting high-quality standards, ensuring the accuracy, and the stability of our DB</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploring and establishing the new abilities we need to develop to further achieve our mission</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Triaging and analyzing potential vulnerabilities discovered within open-source dependencies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using research to verify or disqualify potential vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using data analyst techniques to answer research questions about vulnerabilities, and general threat intelligence trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laying the base for machine learning models to find where vulnerabilities are most likely to exist, using a combination of our unique database of verified known vulnerabilities; information about how the open source community operates; and the static code itself</span></li>
