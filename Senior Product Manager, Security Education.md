<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is used by over 2.8M developers, driven by its successful freemium motion - unique in the security industry - and its focus on putting the developer first. We secure the code you write, with Snyk Code, the libraries you depend upon with Snyk Open Source, the containers you package it all into with Snyk Container and the infrastructure that you run it on with Snyk Infrastructure as Code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key part of our mission is empowering developers to make the best decisions and take the most appropriate action around security issues and we believe that security education integrated seamlessly into the developer workflow plays a key role in this.</span></p>
<p><strong>We're looking for a senior product manager to work as an integral part of a diverse cross-functional team to develop and bring to market an exciting new product offering for security education.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will own the product definition, along with the strategy, roadmap and execution of key product initiatives and associated outcomes.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching, analysing and understanding the market and the competitive and partnership landscapes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking with our users, customers, and potential customers, to understand their needs, gather feedback and requirements, and collaborate with them to build and validate solutions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilising experimentation and data-based decision making, leading by example.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with product analysts to define and analyse metrics to assess experiments and product and business performance, learn more about users and their behavior, and inform decisions.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining and then communicating the product roadmap, both inside Snyk and with customers and prospects</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting and guiding other product managers to help refine plans across Snyk’s product portfolio</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Informing and improving our product processes, and the way all product managers work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring delivered features reach the desired business outcomes</span></li>

<h3><strong>About Snyk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re on a mission to make the world a safer place with more secure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a world of digital transformation that is turning ever more industries into a software-development industry.&nbsp; Cyber security is taking centre stage for many companies, and demand for Snyk’s product is sky-rocketing!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk has already been adopted by over 2.2M developers, including multiple leading enterprise customers such as Google, Salesforce and Intuit, who are using Snyk to find and fix vulnerabilities in their open source libraries and container images, empowering them to develop secure software, faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2021, we raised $300M in Series E funding at a $4.7 billion company valuation, just after securing an additional $200M in Series D funding in September 2020, and successfully closing two strategic acquisitions. On top of that, we doubled the size of our global team, and we’re not stopping there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure. Join us!</span></p>
