<p><strong>Enterprise Account Executive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Chicago</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a collaborative, hard-working Account Executive to join our sales team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source software is growing rapidly: technology is a core part of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t security experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But our team is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a developer tooling company with deep security knowledge: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re focused on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organisations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Your role</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Account Executive at Snyk, you’ll be responsible for the end-to-end sales cycle for prospective customers, taking warm inbound leads, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders in the DevSecOps space and digital transformation teams at companies. Our existing customer base ranges from mid-market companies like to large enterprises like Google and Salesforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want you to contribute to the iterative improvement of our sales process, tone and approach, and you’ll have plenty of scope to inform the way we develop our internal tooling to help you work efficiently and effectively. We’re a collaborative team with different experiences, and we spend time coaching each other, giving and receiving feedback, and ensuring we work together to make the most of the skills and experience we have within the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for highly motivated salespeople who thrive with the freedom to decide how to spend your day, and how best to contribute to your team’s goals.</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have 5+ years experience selling a technical product to Enterprise level accounts (Fortune 100), and you want to hone your craft in a startup on its way to success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy and thrive,working in fast-paced environments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are collaborative with marketing, sales engineers, product, customer success, and others to get your deal done, and work well in a “teaming” environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are resilient: you believe mistakes and failures are learning opportunities, and you value feedback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are open, honest and take an entrepreneurial approach to sales, and mindful of your customer’s risk tolerance</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience in CyberSecurity, Application Security, DevOps, or DevSecOps&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
