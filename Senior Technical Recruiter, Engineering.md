<h3><em><sub>All roles listed as ‘remote’ are available as remote within the same country.</sub></em></h3>
<h3><strong>We’re looking for a senior technical recruiter to own the scaling of our global engineering teams, empowering us to hire exponentially more engineers as we grow, without compromising on our richly diverse workforce and one-team value.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The role:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll report into our global R&amp;D Recruitment Manager and drive recruitment within our engineering organization. You’ll work closely with engineering directors to design and execute on a prioritised hiring strategy across products and teams, build creative sourcing plans to create a richly diverse top of funnel, and also manage pipelines and optimize interview processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom line: You’ll lead the scaling of our engineering organization by helping us hire smarter, building our capability to hire exponentially more great engineers each quarter, whilst reducing the interviewing workload on engineering teams.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Each member of our team has a unique skill-set and area of interest. Here are some other projects you might want to contribute to for Snyk globally:</strong></h3>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building a strong employer brand, including PR and external communications, content and social media strategies, visual brand, and more</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitating an exceptional candidate experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementing creative initiatives to understand and improve the diversity of our global team&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">designing interview processes to minimize our risk of bias and maximize the likelihood of identifying the best candidates</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consulting with hiring managers on market nuances, offer decisions, role titles, and the competition</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have significantly scaled an engineering team before, and understand the challenges&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience hiring software engineers at all levels, from the most junior to the most senior engineering leadership positions&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have worked in-house, partnering and consulting directly with engineering leadership (bonus if you have also worked agency side or RPO)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand technology and can identify which types of software engineers are needed to build which parts of the product: in fact, you feel comfortable advising hiring managers on this too</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have experience recruiting internationally (we’re especially interested to hear from those who’ve hired for companies in Israel)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe in the power of data to help us make better decisions&nbsp;</span></li>
