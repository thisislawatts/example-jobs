<div class="content-intro"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, the world gets more digital thanks to tens of millions of developers building the future faster than ever. But with exponential growth comes exponential risk, as outnumbered security teams struggle to secure mountains of code. This is where Snyk (pronounced “sneak”) comes in. Snyk is a developer security platform that makes it easy for development teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and cloud infrastructure — and do it all right from the start. Snyk is on a mission to make the world a more secure place by empowering developers to develop fast and stay secure.</span></p></div><h2><strong>Enterprise Account Executive</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Location: Singapore</strong></p>
<p>We’re looking for a collaborative, hard-working Enterprise Account Executive to join our sales team.</p>
<p>The use of open source software is growing rapidly: technology is a core part of our lives, and almost all software developers rely on open source components, but security is a key concern. Anyone can find and exploit vulnerabilities within open source code, and most of the people who maintain these projects<a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/#risk-and-impact">&nbsp;aren’t security experts</a>. But our team is.</p>
<p>We’re a developer tooling company with deep security knowledge: this makes us particularly well-positioned to understand the problem space we work in.</p>
<p>We’re focused on enabling developers to find and fix open source vulnerabilities through our proprietary, built from the ground up platform. Our product integrates seamlessly into typical development workflows, and the large organizations that we have on board love us. We want to make security part of business as usual for software developers.</p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p>As an Enterprise Account Executive at Snyk, you’ll be responsible for the end-to-end sales cycle for prospective customers, taking warm inbound leads, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders in the devsecops space and digital transformation teams at companies.&nbsp; This will be a mix of expanding Snyk’s usage in our existing account base and finding, qualifying, and closing opportunities with prospective customers.</p>
<p>We’re looking for highly motivated salespeople who thrive with the freedom to decide how to spend your day, and how best to contribute to your team’s goals.</p>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>You have a minimum experience of 7 years owning the entire sales cycle for a technical product to Enterprise level accounts (Fortune 1000), and you want to hone your craft in a scaling startup on its way to success</li>
<li>You’ve excelled at selling into Cybersecurity, DevOps, or DevSecOps groups within the enterprise segment</li>
<li>You’re self-motivated and hard-working: you aim to exceed your quota, and you enjoy and thrive working in fast-paced environments</li>
<li>You are collaborative with marketing, sales engineers, product, customer success, and others to get your deal done, and work well in a “teaming” environment</li>
<li>You are resilient: you believe mistakes and failures are learning opportunities, and you value feedback</li>
<li>You’re open, honest and take an entrepreneurial approach to sales, mindful of your customer’s risk tolerance</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Interested?</strong></h2>
<p>We'd love to hear from you!</p>
