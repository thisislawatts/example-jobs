<h1><strong>Channel Manager, DACH</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Location: Germany (Remote) </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for an entrepreneurial, driven and analytical channel development professional to establish and build out the Snyk channel partner programme in the DACH region from scratch.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Your role</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our first channel manager for the DACH region, you’ll fundamentally shape the way in which the channel is built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be responsible for building out a successful channel programme from scratch: identifying the best first geography, market and channel type and prove out a model. You will be expected to bundle our solution with other dev or security tools, resell via VARs or MSSPs, or integrate into cloud and digital transformation initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this role you will establish the first channel relationships with new partners that you bring, and you'll build a model of those relationships that can scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other things, you’ll spend your time:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding how to make channel work for Snyk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market mapping and exploring various channel strategies for the company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signing up channel partners on the program</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">structuring and defining program KPIs, training, marketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">modelling out what you need in order to scale program - both people and resources</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executing with partners in collaboration with our sales team to get deals and revenue</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll give you the freedom you need to thrive, including defining and achieving ambitious goals. Your work will influence our long-term growth and the scope of our future success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 15% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organisational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<h2><strong>You should join us if:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have direct experience in channel development and scaling, specifically in the software security space</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have background in software security, open source, DevOps, cloud or dev tooling space</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You build meaningful relationships and love to find mutually beneficial opportunities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand how large and small channel partners work, and how as a startup we can best partner with them</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are process-oriented </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are open, honest, outcome-driven and take an entrepreneurial approach</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re excited about the opportunity to build an effective, impactful channel programme!</span></li>
