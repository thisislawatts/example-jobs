<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk we care deeply about our developer experience and productivity. It requires constant innovation as we increase our product breadth and depth, and scale our footprint globally to enable millions of external developers through our security products, all while maintaining high availability and reliability of our platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are looking for an experienced Engineering Manager who is passionate about DevOps, Cloud Native Infrastructure, and enabling their fellow engineers by paving a road for teams to ship continuously and reliably to Production. For Snyk, Production covers a multi-cluster, multi-region design across a range of deployment options: Multi-tenant SaaS, Single-tenant SaaS, and On Prem solutions. There is a huge opportunity to innovate in the delivery and release engineering aspects of targeting many environments on each code push!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be managing the Developer Experience team whose focus is to accelerate fellow engineers to ship code quickly, reliably, and with minimum cognitive overhead. You will work closely with the Cloud Platforms and SRE teams within the Infra Group. Snyk is a fast-growing business with close to 200 engineers. We are set to nearly double that in the next year!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining the developer experience strategy at Snyk by outlining to your team best practices around testing, deploying, and releasing software and infrastructure changes quickly and reliably with the constant aim of decreasing the cognitive load on engineers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will set KPIs and metrics around delivery performance and quality for R&amp;D. Correlated success for this team would be to observe KPIs improving at a team and group level across R&amp;D through the tooling and consultancy provided by your team.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will give teams the tools and insights so that they can make local changes to drive more efficient flow. Currently we are using CodeClimate Velocity and would welcome more ideas on how to capture insights and derive actions for acceleration and high performance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working cross-functionally with Snyk’s R&amp;D teams to help them make best use of the Developer Experience “paved road”. Identifying and leading the build-out of new capabilities within this area.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing the day-to-day Agile practices of the team, striving for predictable and repeatable success.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing, mentoring, coaching, and moving the personal development of individuals on your team forward.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience in hiring, coaching, and growing engineers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have worked in a similar team/domain before where enabling internal teams was the core focus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An excellent ability to empathise with your customers, which are happily other engineers. You are energised by helping teams and organisations accelerate through consultancy, tooling adoption, and education.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hands-on experience as an Infrastructure Engineer, SRE, or similar – implementing Cloud Native architectures for various domains and contexts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate proactively, are comfortable working across departments and teams to build bridges and create valuable feedback loops into your team’s plans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have experience building and maintaining automation tooling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are willing to inspect and change the status quo – to discover fresh ideas on how infrastructure is built, delivered, and operated at scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience of working in a geographically distributed team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience of working with multiple cloud providers, CI/CD tools, and delivery metrics platforms.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/devsecops-insights-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security is a key concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with our engineering teams based mostly in London and Tel Aviv, and 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. Not to mention that we have an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Snyk, we are experiencing rapid growth and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2020 alone, Snyk had already over 600,000 registered users, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, Salesforce, Mastercard, BBC, and others). We also raised an additional $200 million, </span><a href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-closes-200m-to-modernize-security-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced September, 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, we have partnered with Stripes, along with Coatue, Tiger Global, BoldStart, Trend Forward, Amity and Salesforce Ventures, to build on our 2019 momentum and continue to fuel our developer-first approach to security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
