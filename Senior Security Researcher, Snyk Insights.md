<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for a passionate and collaborative Senior Security Researcher to join our new group to help us build the new Snyk Insights product of Snyk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Native App Sec has become complicated to track and manage. Apps are composed of many services and their components (e.g. code, containers), generating diverse and long lists of vulnerabilities that are hard to manage. Many of these component vulnerabilities don't expose the app as a whole, resulting in lots of noise and expensive triage time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this pain, customers need an application focused solution that looks at their security posture in a holistic fashion - we're building a Snyk Insights product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
