<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mapping out how these organizations work: identifying how departments and teams interact, the internal processes for getting things done, and understanding how the teams which already use Snyk can help us expand within the org.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">becoming a product expert for the new features and products our engineering teams release, and introducing these to existing clients</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand people: what makes them tick, what their attitude is to us, when they’re most likely to want to buy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are organized, rigorous, and love to improve processes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited about what we’re doing and want to join a startup on its way to success</span></li>
