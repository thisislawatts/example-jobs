<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">XYZ</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company we are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You should apply if you:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">XYZ</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>We’d especially love to hear from you if you:</strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are looking for candidates with existing experience with our tech stack we believe curiosity, communication, and the ability to learn are most important.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What does our interview process look like?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We start by having a video call to get to know you. We’ll tell you more about us, the role, and why our culture is so great! We also want to hear about you, your skills and experience, and why you are interested in exploring Snyk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up we’ll send you a take home exercise. Ideally, you will get it back to us within a week and we can take a look at your work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there we’ll have an onsite interview where you will get to visit our office, meet a few different members of the BI team, and other stakeholders either in person or over Zoom, and find out everything you need to know about the way we work.&nbsp;</span></p>
