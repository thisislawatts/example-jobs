<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk is used by over 1.5M developers, driven by its successful freemium motion - unique in the security industry. Growing this rapid adoption is critical to Snyk’s mission of driving developer first security, and a core pillar of Snyk’s business success.</span></p>
<p><strong>We're looking for a director of product management who can lead Snyk’s freemium, user success and self-service purchase efforts, driving the product-led growth of Snyk’s disruptive developer-first security platform.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will own the top-level company vision and KPIs for our product-led growth, from accelerating viral growth of users signing up, to making them even more successful in finding and fixing their security issues, all the way to having them self-serve to become paying customers. Snyk has been a developer-focused company from day one, gaining most of its commercial interest bottom-up and directly from developers. You will now scale this motion, taking Snyk to the next level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be managing a product group, working closely with a distributed team of designers and developers, as well as with our marketing, business development and customer success teams on driving joint efforts in order to reach the highest market impact.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You’ll spend your time</strong></h3>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing and hiring a group of top-notch product managers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentoring and coaching your team, while nurturing a collaborative environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working very closely with the R&amp;D and design teams in order to create a differentiated, developer friendly offering.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define, own and implement the product-led growth KPIs that would drive our development. Establish a data driven mindset, where everything important is measured</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foster a developer-centric mindset – researching, testing and iterating to see what best fits developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with customers, prospects and users to get their feedback, discuss their challenges and gain a full understanding of their needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing the product vision for your group, then sharing it and ensuring efforts are aligned to it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating your teams' work internally and externally, including to executive management and the Board of Directors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading key partnership activities, in collaboration with Business Development, that aim at significantly growing Snyk’s user base&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working closely with Marketing, Developer Relations and Customer Success teams to efficiently drive growth activities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern (</span><a href="https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By September 2020, Snyk was already adopted by over 1.5M developers, including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). Our September 2020 Series D funding round of $200M has put us at over $2.5Billion company valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
