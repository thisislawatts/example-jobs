<p><strong>We’re looking for a super organised and empathic Recruiting Coordinator with a flair for problem-solving, to help Snyk create a seamless, enjoyable and scalable recruiting process for all.  </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Recruiting Coordinator for Snyk, you’ll support growth in our R&amp;D departments across EMEA, reporting into our R&amp;D Recruitment Lead and working closely with hiring managers on teams including engineering, product, security and data.  </span></p>
<p><strong>You’ll spend your time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being the main point of contact for candidates, keeping them regularly updated and excited throughout the process</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scheduling interviews, whether by video-call or on-site, with multiple interviewers across a range of timezones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet candidates onsite and provide a positive candidate experience throughout the process</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordinating between hiring managers, interviewers, and recruiters to keep candidates moving swiftly through the process</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with third parties (including employment advisors, recruiting agencies and job platform reps)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guiding new hires into the onboarding process, creating contracts, and providing a seamless handover to our People Experience team</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are distributed across four offices in London, Tel Aviv, Boston and Ottawa, with 10% of the company working fully-remote. We’ve made an organizational commitment to building a strong, effective, distributed company: we form teams across multiple offices wherever possible, and we invest in communication so that we can benefit from each others’ perspectives. As well as an always-on webcam so we can see what’s happening in each office, we make heavy use of video calls, Slack, and some inter-office travel.</span></p>
<p><strong>You should apply if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you have at least 2+ years experience in recruiting coordination, ideally within a high growth technical scaleup environment, and are comfortable with high volume recruiting </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re highly organised and enjoy organising others too</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can effectively prioritise a large and varied to-do list, thrive when juggling multiple tasks at once, and feel confident even when priorities change</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re a natural relationship-builder, always over-communicate, and believe in transparency by default</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you enjoy making things work better, solving problems and making others’ lives easier</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re comfortable in an external-facing role with a lot of written communication</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ve had experience balancing diary coordination across multiple time-zones and locations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you really enjoy meeting new people from all walks of life and value diversity</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What projects could you get involved with?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re growing fast!  To enable this, we’re focussed on building out our hiring infrastructure to allow us to recruit at scale without compromising on candidate or team experience.  We’re designing and documenting new processes, building out our employer brand strategy, implementing GDPR, focussing down on diversity and inclusion efforts, and training interviewers across the org.  We’d love your help!</span></p>

<p><strong>About Snyk</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of open source is booming, but security is a key concern.  Snyk’s unique product enables developers and enterprise security teams to continuously find &amp; fix vulnerable dependencies without slowing down, offering seamless integration into Dev, DevOps and DevSecOps workflows. We care deeply about the quality and usefulness of the tools we develop, always focusing on our customers and users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are experiencing rapid growth - and we want you to join us! By the end of Q3 2019 alone, Snyk was already adopted by over 450,000 developers, and including multiple enterprise customers (such as Google, New Relic, ASOS and others). We also raised an additional $70 Million, </span><a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-open-source-security-platform-snyk-raises-70m-1001300189"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced September 10, 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  from investors such as Accel, GV and Boldstart, demonstrating that they are as excited as we are by Snyk’s progress and potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe open source software is a force for good, and we’re building Snyk to make it easier for developers who aren’t security experts to stay secure.</span></p>
